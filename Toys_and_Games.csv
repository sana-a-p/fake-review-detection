It appears they were printed in layers of blues, reds and yellows to make each ocean animal image, but the printing didn't overlap perfectly to make a crisp picture. You can see a bit of each primary color around the edges of each animal, thus making the finer details (like eyes and little fins) fuzzy. There were also thin black lines streaking thru the images.

- beautiful paint and coloring, very true to life
- no open areas in the plastic so it can go in the bath with no risk of mold
- very good size compared to other ocean animal toys, so it has the feeling of being whale like!

It is pretty heavy and the fins are hard plastic. I suppose it could hurt to step on, or hit a sibling with, but this is a great whale shark. If you're a marine enthusiast I could see it working as a display for adult collectors as well since it's life-like (not cartoony).",0

The set assembles fairly easily and for the most part stays together.  We use it more as a decoration to store her ponies on the shelf nicely. Since it is so flat, the ponies can go in front of it.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Purchased for a seven year old for Halloween 2016. He has tried it on and it fits him great, sized exactly right. He cannot wait to wear it. Seems put together well; the boots have a little Velcro strap to try and keep them down around the shoe. The outfit was easy for him to put on; the cape comes off for easy changing and he had a little wiggle room so he can wear some long underwear or thermals under it when we go out trick-or-treating. The mask fits perfect as well; there are little cushions in the mask so the plastic isn't right on his face. So far, very good buy; cheap and fits him perfectly.",0

My daughter just turned 7 so this game was a little too easy for her, but she still loves it.  This InnoTab game allows children to choose easy or difficult levels. Sofia talks to her friends to get clues to find the door for her class, as they have been changed. Behind the doors are the classes where games are played such as matching game, art class and find the missing pieces. The game has seven learning games and two creative activities to teach counting, colors, patterns, problem solving and more! Definitely fun and educational but I wouldn't recommend for 6 or older, possibly 6 if they still need learning help.",0

Unfortunately for small children, it's too bulky to really stack, and the drum and tambourine are too difficult to remove.  The piano plays pre-set songs, or tracks of songs, rather than notes, so children have to listen thru before they engage again.  Would have preferred individual sounds as (at least) an option.  Because of the way the sound settings work, and the ease in which the cymbal can activate, ours essentially plays one song over and over again.

What I didn't like about this product is that one of th sides didn't come with the correct predrilled holes, and after contacting Amazon and Hape, I could not get a replacement part. They did offer several other ""solutions"" but bottom line is, the top of my kitchen still isn't properly secured on one sid because the holes weren't secured properly and I could not get a replacement part.

I'm not sure how educational it is, but I will say that it does help younger children with visual discrimination which is a prereading skill. Because this is a card game it is somewhat prone to being destroyed by young hands. However, the cards are larger than normal playing cards and very sturdy.

However, we are trying to be gentle with it. My son and I like to play bowling with it as well as air hockey. We have soft, stuffed bowling pins and just use them as the pushers and the soccer disc as the puck down our hallway. My son also enjoys spinning it around and watching the lights in motion. Even my 2 1/2 year old enjoys kicking it. It is a tad bit noisy on our tile floor but I wouldn't say it is too bothersome.",0

If you cant have eyes on your baby every second (I have two older children I need to watch too) this float is not safe once your baby can stand.

This float would be great for younger children and I would have given it four stars if it hadn't been advertised for children through 2 years old.

Also very pleased with how resilient they are! Each of us crashed them on our first attempts to fly them, including a couple of crashes on our high ceilings and all the back down to the ground, and they still run great!

They run for about 20 minutes of flight time and take about 40 minutes to charge. Based on reviews I read if other flying toys or drones that is a pretty good ratio.

There is a good variety of shapes and sizes, and this 60-piece set is a nice size.  I think if you had a smaller set, it would be difficult to build much, but 60 is enough.  The reason I am giving these four stars instead of five is that these tiles are clearly not as ""sticky"" as MagnaTiles, which are also significantly pricier.  These tiles do not stick together as well because the tiles are thicker, which has the effect of making the magnets seem weaker.

Making the leg holes even 1 inch bigger would be great, and make the body hole 4 inches smaller in circumference would balance this out better.
For direct overhead shade, this shade stands up but wobbles. Perhaps an extra snap button loop towards the front and next to the existing ones would give it more stability. Overall, for the price, durability, and value. We are happy. Also nice to have something baby that is NOT so bulky while porting everything else around.",0

Strangely the green engine that comes with this set is the only train that has a problem passing under the bridge. This is out of 15 different train cars by different makers. On a perfectly flat surface its not an issue but on carpet the green engine must be push/pulled through the overpass.

My other issue is the engines don't have magnets on the front. The Thomas and Chuggington engines all have magnets on the front and back. So there are times they get ignored in favor of other trains that don't have to take the lead. However the trailing cars do have magnets on both sides.

This toy is amazing. It's the perfect size for my little girl and she loves it! She loves it. The colors are bright, vibrant, and it's a great toy for the toddler or the adult.

I highly recommend this teepee, especially for the price! I wouldn't bother with the more expensive ones because they are only larger (and this ones large!). My son has a standard sized bedroom & this teepee definitely fills out the room.  Wouldn't want anything bigger then this one! If my son had a master sized room I would maybe consider something large but not worth paying almost triple for.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"At first I thought there was something wrong with this game.  After a couple minutes I realized the game can sense your hand movement behind the buttons also.  The trick is to not move the hand that you are holding it with or it will read a touch.  The game is so sensitive it can read your hand just hovering above the touch panels, and quite accurately.  After learning the trick I like it very much because you can light up the pattern much quicker than the old games.  The slide game works quite well.
The only thing about this game is wasn't crazy about is that I like classic Simon and the game will only use the left side of each color, pressing the other side will result in a buzz and lost game.
Overall I would say the the game is an improvement over the old hard press Simon games.",0

2) the Hinterlands challenge- we haven't played this one yet. About animal outbreaks as well?
3) THE SUPERBUG CHALLENGE!!! This is awesome. There is a 5th (purple) disease and to win you must CURE & ERADICATE the 5th disease and well as cure the 4 original ones. But it is also harder to cure the purple disease and you treat it differently than the originals. Super fun.

That said, it isn't a big issue. If we want the end to be flat we hold it down with books or something similar. We have only used the suction cup attqchment. It works very well, we stick it on the window and it stays very securely. The track is flexible, so sometimes we put things under the track to create variety.

The only challenge I have learned with purchasing balloons online is finding somewhere to get them inflated.  I was able to find a grocery store here in town to finally do it, but it was definitely more expensive than just purchasing from them or pretty much anywhere else.

These balloons were not expensive, it was the getting them inflated with helium that got costly.  I think it was like $1.60 per balloon.

Overall, the quality and appearance of the balloons was nice.  I would definitely recommend these balloons, but be forewarned that you may run into more expense than you anticipated with inflating them.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"HALO is a major franchise, a known world populated with a diverse group of races.
Mega Bloks is doing HALO right providing an excellent selection of races and their vehicles in well thought out kits.
The 2014 line is no exception and this is one of the better items released this year.

The Mega Bloks HALO aircraft always make an impressive item while being both fun and challenging to build.
Priced at less than nine cents for each piece, this 716-piece kit is well worth buying.
The included figures enhance this sets value for collectors.
First is the newly designed super articulated Master Chief with customize armor.
The newly designed Cortina has an odd face but this figure is always popular with collectors.
Lastly, is the giant Did figure.
The Didact introduced in HALO 4, are an important part of the story.
Currently, this is the only kit that has a Didact figure.

The completed kit sits on a clear base giving the impression of flight.

This kit is something every collector and HALO builder will want.",0

He even had fun pretending that he was looking for Big Foot. The handles are very easy to hold, and the periscope is light weight making it easy to bring on a nature walk or hike. My 3 year old even had a blast playing with it. The periscope can be used inside as well to peek behind couches and ""spy"" on siblings or parents. That makes it a great toy for sunny AND rainy days! The light makes it fun to explore at night too so this would be a great toy to bring on a camping trip! This periscope is also durable which is a must when being used by little ones!

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This is a really menacing figure, as befits the guard dog of the underworld of Hades. It's a sturdy figure, but may not be that suitable for smaller children due to the rough edges and fairly sharp detail on the figure.

What I got it for was for use in roleplaying games. The figures for those games, of which D&D is a great example, are usually of the 25/28mm or 1/72 scale. In that scale, this figure is huge, the size of a bus. For some reason, that's how I've always pictured Cerberus, so it works for me. If you're looking for something more the size of a large dog, then this won't be for you. Otherwise, it will surely have players breaking into a nervous sweat when it's brought to the gaming table.

The sculpt is dynamic and properly fierce looking, and it stands well on its own. The paint scheme is simple but very well-done. Overall, a very good figure for those interested in Greek mythology.",0

It collapses to easily (just while playing), the gears do not stay on- as soon as you turn either on the end they ALL pop off, and the nails pretty much fall right into the holes. If you are looking for a toy for your little boy (or girl ) to tinker around with I highly suggest the LeapFrog Fix and Learn Speedy. The drivers are a wrench and screw driver that are very toddler friendly to grasp and 'work' with, cutesy (not annoying) songs, it cues when something on Speedy breaks and needs some fixing and of course doubles as a race car. Speedy gets played with daily by my son (which says a lot for a toy).

But what thrilled me is that her mom leaves it out in the living room because the little one plays with it CONSTANTLY! I can't believe it but, 6 months later, she still loves it and plays with it as much as when it was new. Everyone gets a daily cone. Visitors must order what they want. And she still plays with it on her own.

Plus, we all pay with the cash. She tells us how much we owe - $1 for each scoop plus $1 for a topping. She figures the cost on her own and knows when she's been given the correct amount.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,I love this blue version of the Petit BearGguy! I loved the mini one like this that came with the white BearGguy kit and when I saw them being sold separately in different colors I had to get them all. They are the same mold but each one comes with a jigsaw puzzle shaped base that connects with the others so you can form a combined base in a variety of configurations. Each one also comes with the attachment piece so any of the bigger BearGguy models can alternately hold hands (paws) with it if you want. Since they're all the same mold you can also swap pieces and make custom multicolor as well. Whether you use them as add-ons for other models or just want to display them alone they are really cute and very simple to build. You do not need to know Japanese to understand the instructions and these mini models would also make great starter kits for newbies just getting interested in gunpla.,0

When we came back one of the cars wouldn't operate as it did before we left.  We did some switched batteries and tried some minor problem solving but the car just wouldn't work correctly.  Contacted the company and received a prompt response back.  Did the steps as was recommended to us from Tech Support and then gave them the results.  They again responded promptly and advised that they would need to send out a calibration tool but with the holidays and such we wouldn't have it until after the 1st of the year.  No problems here.

The one problem that we encountered is that the engine of the train provided is too tall to go under the bridge of the set.  This proves to be very frustrating to my grandson who really has problems with things of this nature.  He likes to be in control of the environment and wants things to work as they are designed to work.

The chefs hat has a nice thick comfy pink band around the head and the white part is a soft, almost silky feeling type of fabric. It lays nicely and is not stiff to fit oddly or stand up awkwardly.

The little over mit and pot holder are quilted and adorable.

The apron is put together so nicely with nice thick material and perfect hems.

The utensil set is a thick hard plastic but has no rough edges to worry about scratching any surfaces. I thought they'd be more like dollar store quality acrylic utensils, but they're not. They're cute and nice quality.

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is.",0

It takes a few hours to learn the basic rules, then a few play-throughs to understand the mechanics, and then hundreds of hours to fully grasp the potential of deckbuilding within the universe.

However, if you have one hardcore friend who loves strategy games and deckbuilding, putting in the time to learn Netrunner together will probably be worth it. Just understand that Netrunner is a lot more like Magic than like Pandemic or other highly-reviewed board games, and determine whether that's your cup of tea before proceeding.",0

He can take it around the house and it's great for him to keep on his car. This is a great toy for him and he loves to play with it. He can also use it on his carpeted floor. I wish I would have known about it before it went on sale. Great product, very durable. My son loves this toy. The kids were excited about it, but it was a bit small. We had to take it apart. So we had to buy it from Amazon. We bought it for a Christmas gift for my son. I am going to order another for him. Very cute!This is a great starter kit for little ones.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My 4-year-old and nearly 2-year-old both love this toy! My 4-year-old loves to make the different bunny houses according to the pictures in the book. It's really boosted her confidence to be figuring things out on her own, plus I feel like it's laying the ground work for simple math and patterns. She also enjoys coming up with her own structures. The nearly 2-year-old loves to fiddle with the bricks and build her own little structures for the bunnies to sit on. The set is a great balance of building blocks, plus the ""extras"" of a fence piece, carrots, bowl and flowers.

We unfortunately lost the brown bunny a couple weeks ago, and never found it. After looking around on ebay, I finally used the Lego website to ask for a replacement part. Their customer service was excellent--I was on hold less than a minute and they were very proactive in helping me out.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"If you love strategy games, I can't recommend this game enough. It's the U.S. versus Russia during the Cold War and you can feel the tension as each side tries to control countries around the world. You get to live through most of the major events of that time period because they are actually played out in the game.

I'm not sure the word ""fun"" would best describe this game - you are certainly not laughing your way to victory with a wacky group of friends. But if your idea of ""fun"" is deep strategy, constant awareness of how each new event changes the world's politics- and therefore your alliance and chance of winning, and tough decision making, then you will LOVE this game!
I would say the learning curve is moderate as there are a lot of things to keep track of, but once you get a few plays in, things are smooth sailing.

I used it with kids from roughly ages 3 - 9. They loved taking out the pizzas and getting them out of their pizza boxes. They also loved the silly toppings like a soccer ball or stinky sock. My 3-year-old likes playing the game, but he also likes pretending he is baking the pizzas in the oven (which is the game box). It lends itself well to adaptation and being creative with the instructions. It's durable, survived lots of kids. Kids are very competitive and did not really like that there is no winner, but I did like that aspect. It helped with working on teamwork skills. Great game, especially for the price!",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"As a former sporting goods purchasing agent for Kmart about 15-16 years ago - when the first mass production of metal scooters were being imported from China - I can say that I've seen a few scooters in my lifetime. Some of those sample scooters lasted me until today - scooters my kids can still enjoy these days. This is a scooter with a great concept for power - it's all manual yet very simple to operate. The one big issue I have with this item that otherwise claims to hold riders up to 90 kg =200lbs(surprisingly, this is the same weight limit as the jr. model, which is aimed at 4-8 year olds) is the following: the plastic enclosure at the bottom of the scooter, the part that holds a wire and is close to the ground seems extremely fragile. I venture to say if a kid rides on the sidewalk and then decides to go jump on the street, that plastic piece could easily get smashed in the sidewalk corner, and render the entire scooter useless.",0

Let's face it-Tauntauns do not grow on trees in the Lego world and are exclusive to this set.  The fact that it also comes with two Snowtroopers, the Han Solo and two Rebels means 5 minifigs and said Tauntan for $40+ the other portions of the scene.  A pretty good value.  On it's own this scene can clearly shows a solid Hoth scene-but is by no means huge.

As part of a larger Hoth scene, this becomes essential.  I have added it to the Limited Edition Echo Base 7879, Hoth Wampa Cave 8089, Hoth Rebel Base 7666 one additional Echo Base, two Motorized At-At's (10178), other dark gray and white misc pieces AND white dog toy stuffing for quite the display.

However, the prongs that hold the stall doors in place break VERY easily - 2 of 6 are down for the count within the first month. One broke through play - granted, he is a 3 year old boy and is not exactly ""gentle"" with his toys - but the other broke during assembly.  It was easy to put this barn together so there was minimal force applied.  I contacted Breyer for some replacement doors, but was informed that they do not have a parts department.

  12 Non-roll markers
  24 Triangular colored pencils
  10 Jumbo Chalk sticks

My daughters love to play the LPS app on their Kindles so getting more animals to add is a huge plus for them. Their previous LPS toys coordinate nicely with this set too. What I like is that it can all be stored away in a labeled plastic bin with a lid (I use a clear medium sized Rubbermaid bin), so nothing gets lost.

I will say, we didn't know the girl well ahead of time, so we weren't sure of her crafting level. At 10, friendship bracelets were all the rage in my school, and all the girls were making them on the playground or between breaks. But not every kid is adept or interested.

My daughter got this for her birthday and has played with this probably 15 whole minutes, if that (she is 16 months old now). The motor is so loud you can't hear the music over it, and it just doesn't keep her attention for long at all. The loud noise may scare your kid, it has scared my daughter a few times when she hits it by accident. One thing I like about this toy is when my cats accidentally hit it it goes off and it is pretty hilarious watching them scurry, since they aren't supposed to be in her playroom. Giving it three stars because it does what it advertises it does, but pretty much is boring and not very entertaining for my one year old, and there are cheaper and more entertaining toys out there.",0

There are some basic instructions, but it is not clear that the doors are going to open and close.  If you are looking for a good learning tool for a 2 year old, the steps are not very easy.  I think this is a good learning tool for a 2 year old.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the doors, but I would buy this again for our little one.

Overall, it's a great learning tool for a 2 year old.  We bought it for a Christmas gift for our 2 year old who has learned to use the sounds.  I would recommend it for a 3 year old who is learning to use sounds as well as words.  We are not sure if it is a good tool for older",1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Kid really likes these Smart Toys games - travel and full size.

Pros:
1) A travel game with fairly strong magnets
2) A cute penguin theme

Cons:
1) There is no place to store the unused magnets while the child is trying to figure out a solution - they just fall all over the car floor or lap. What might fix this is to have both sides be magnetic: one side - game board, one side - staging area. And put the game options on harder cardboard that flip out the top and bottom.

2) The solutions. I wish they were somehow hidden or in another section. I've worked with my kid on ""it's not as much fun if you don't figure it out on your own"" but once he figured out that the solutions were in the back - he just spent his time copying the solutions. I don't even know how to address this one - I gave him to toy to entertain him while we were setting up and breaking down camp and for the car, in lieu of a screen, so I couldn't sit there and play with him.",0

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole).

It doesn't take long to play (only three minutes to be exact) and you don't need a lot of space to play it.  It uses a lot of the same skills as scrabble, but unlike in scrabble you won't keep getting beaten every time by that brainy uncle who must have memorized the dictionary, because most of the words that can be found are only 3 or 4 letters long, and even younger kids have a fair chance to win(occasionally a very long word can be found however - my personal triumph was the 8-letter ""nicotine"").  Also, you WILL learn new words you never knew existed from this game when people guess them and make you look them up - crazy words like ""hie"" and ""tat"" and ""coe"".  Overall a very fun game well worth buying, although I wish they still made the bigger version, because that one's a lot of fun too.",0

The goggles are awesome and so cute.  They look like the ones my daughter uses.

This set can be used with any 18 inch size dolls.

My daughter is going to love that it has a helmet and Goggles. She was just talking about a pair for her dolls.

Pros:

Well made thick plastic
Easy to put together
Fun colors
Great Price
Quick Shipping

The boots are plastic, but they're not plastic, so it's not like they're made of rubber.  I would think it would be better to have two boots for the same price.  I also think it's a good idea to have a few extra boots in your home.  This is not a big deal for us, because it's a very inexpensive toy.  But I would be disappointed if they included a few extra boots for the price.

My son was excited when I showed him he little brief case and it enticed him away from the tv and video games.  He sat engrossed in the activity books for about an hour, but said it became too redundant And boring.
He liked the red magnifying glass that revealed secret symbols to help him with the activities and the decoder pens.
The product is well packaged and  intriguing for kids to want to pick up to open (which is common with most Melissa and Doug products).
The age range for this toy is probably 7+. I'm disappointed as a parent because my child has not shown additional interest since the first day of opening this product. As I mentioned, I think it's a good concept at a good price point, but not sure if it's worth an hour of entertainment.",0

3. I have two complaints:  1) when it arrived in the mail, there was a chip in the paint, so the light seeped through. If it comes new with paint chip, it's going back!  2) this globe does not spin freely, and we all know, the best fun about a globe is the spin, so a kid can spin it and randomly point her finger to see what country she should go to....  that's the fun.

So, I'm still hunting for the perfect globe for a present for my grandniece, one that lights up, has a good easy spin, and has topographical texture...  the hunt continues...

It folds together into a block (nice touch) and has a very good latching mechanism that blends well with the case design.  You could also store a few into the play area of the case when you close it up.  While not very large, when the case opens up there is a play area on the back with several blocks painted to resemble various ores.  A nice little touch.  The plastic seems to be very durable and is a nice looking product overall.

It is funny how it progresses and it can change personality. But if you are aware of that feature, it makes it okay, especially if you know how to control the personalities.

This one is a nice set of blues and the amount of animation and movement is impressive for robotic toy in the price range that I paid ($30). So we will have fun with it and since it 'evolves' it will hopefully last longer than some other toys that disappear in a week.

However, the real role playing can only be taught by a good role model. That includes explaining that Barbie's body measurements are not realistic. This could lead to a discussion about being comfortable with our curves or lack thereof. Maybe even a discussion of anorexia versus obesity. That is why I highly encourage mothers (and grandmothers) to spend some time playing with their daughters.

Also, because of the way the clothing is sewn on, it does not lift up far enough for you to really put the diaper up around the doll's bottom. So the diaper was a waste as well. The quality of the doll's hair was horrible! She looked like she was going bald! If I had to do it all over again I would buy a Baby Alive. At least you can change their clothes, they actually have real looking diapers (not like this one which was a thin piece of cloth, not even resembling a diaper) and they actually eat and drink. This one may be a hit with younger toddlers but not for girls who are older than 5. And even at that, I would NOT pay $45+ dollars for this. It should be $20 at the most.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"I think it's a nice little rattle that my 4 months old daughter plays with for few mins each day. It lights up and the lights change colors everytime you tap it so it captures the baby's attention. my daughter loves trying to put the face part into her mouth but since she cant, she settles with just sucking on the ears. She also tries tosuck on the middle part but she cant get to it.. its not long enough and with the two bulky ends, it just doesnt fit her face. When I was buying, I thought it would be a good teething toy also but that didn't work out too well. There is also a mirror on the bottom that my daughter looks at for few mins but why look at the small mirror when you have a color changing face!  Its a cool toy that does what it says it does but at the end of the day, it is regular toy- a rattle, that I am not sure I would pay $20 for.

This bag of bricks did not disappoint!  They worked perfectly with the Lego brand blocks and base plates we own. This pastel color collection is great for boys or girls. My son was excited because he said it had ""ice cream"" colors. Overall, we are very pleased and happy to have a great collection of bricks.

I remember playing game after game of Connect Four with my kids when they were young.  I even played it a lot with one daughter when she had to be under a mist tent in the hospital.  It's the only thing that wouldn't fall apart!  Those memories flooded back when one of these big versions was in the waiting room at Texas Children's Hospital.  My grandson had a ball with it while waiting to have his tonsils out.  HE wasn't interested in playing by the rules (he's 3), but he liked putting the discs in and then getting them to drop out.  When he got tired of doing that, he turned the discs into pretend food to use with the kitchen set.

The downside to this is I have had to pick up all of the discs many times as the 3 year olds (he has a twin brother) scatter them every where.  Oh well, that's what kids do.  We are working on getting them to help pick them up.  At least there is a convenient way to store them.",0

I pulled on different body parts and they are not coming off this dog. Very safe for littles ones. Skye is adorable and has a velcro strap underneath so Skye can go from a stuffed animal to a pillow in a snap! Skye's colors are very vivid and attractive to little ones. Sky is very soft and plushy and super comfortable to lay your head on. After reviewing Skye, I gave her to my granddaughter who sleeps with her every single night. She hasn't let her go since she got it!! Overall I'm impressed with the quality overall with this stuffed animal/pillow pet. She's got the cutest little face so what little girl or boy wouldn't want her as their own. This stuffed animal doesn't talk or do any special tricks, I'm pretty sure it's meant to be a stuffed animal and a pillow :)",0

First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

 After having bad luck with kites in the past, I was nervous about trying another kite, but I'm so glad we did.  Finally, a kite we can enjoy, store nicely, and lasts more than a few times.  This kite will last for a long time, and even comes with an exceptional guarantee, the ""Sea-'n'Tree NO-LOSS Guarantee"".  Funny, but amazing!

I've been flying this thing for about a week non-stop now with at least 3-4 total hours of flight time logged so far. (It only gets 5-7 minutes per charge so I've flown it like at least 30 times already) And I have crashed it way over 100 times already.

It is an elaborate, but passive, molded plastic toy, like ""free"" toys included with some kid's meals by big chains, but much bigger.  The excitement may not be proportional to the toy's size.

It comes with enough pieces that two children can have fun with without actually fighting over them, but you know kids, they still might.

The highlight of the set is definitely the timer which actually works and my little one has been having fun ""making dishes"" while using the timer, the way we do in our own kitchen. The salt and pepper shaker actually shakes so she pretends to put them on her food as well. They are all perfectly sized for small hands and with no small pieces, it would be great for kids as young as two.

You can read from the description what comes in the set so I'm not going to bore you with that, but what I can say is this is a must buy.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.

Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.

Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.

Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!

Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games.",0

The little black clips slide around and make it hard for gameplay, as most of us don't remember how many points we have on the cards. One member of our group used some pieces of note card to pad under the clips, it helped if you don't feel like replacing the parts.
It's a good game to play with 6 people, although it does take seemingly forever to get to your turn again (i was always the last player to go, so it didn't help).
I wish i wasn't a visual learner sometimes, because when people read off their cards it's a bit hard to follow, but i just asked for the card to be passed around the group if there was nothing ""secret"" on it.
With six people playing it can take 3 hours of playtime, depending on how the game goes. We got this for our D&D group for when some players cannot show up but we still want to play something.

I tested them against Crayola, Prang, Rose Art, and Prismacolor Soft Core Pencils.  They color so much smoother  than the Crayola, Prang, and Rose Art.  They definitely are not a replacement for Prismacolor pencils, they are still a step below them.  The pencils sharpen very nicely just using the Prismacolor Scholar sharpener (it's the green one).

Snow White's hair is very stiff & shouldn't get messed up easily.
Her shoes will not stay on.  We're thinking of using double-sided sticky tape to see that will work. If that doesn't work, we might glue the shoes on...then again, we might forget about the shoes & let Snow White go barefoot.
Her skirt can be removed; the top piece of her skirt is sparkly.
Snow White has a plastic tiara that seems like it can't be pulled off. Granddaughter's sleeping with Snow White now, so I can't check.

The Play-Doh that comes out of the tubes is not traditional Play-Doh. It's a softer compound making it easy enough for kids to squeeze. The Styler gun is simple to use; the kids didn't need any help changing it out. My 3 year old was able to do it a couple of times, but couldn't after his hands were reportedly ""wet"". I'm not sure if he had been putting his fingers in his or just clammy kid hands. I don't know why, sometimes kids just got clammy hands, they don't know either. Anyway aside from ""wet"" hands the kids were able to completely utilize the DohVinci Styler.

Another point about it not being traditional Play-Doh is that it's not reusable. When you finished with regular Play-Doh the kids clean it up by putting it back in the container it came in for use another day. This DohVinci Play-Doh is a one shot deal. It has to be thought of as more of an Art project medium than regular Play-Doh.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).

I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"With the soft sounds and colors, this toy is a superb companion for any toddler and introduce him/her to the subtleties of music. Our 15 months old liked this toy but it is a bit early for him to get engaged with it. It seems to be more suitable for an 18 months old as recommended by the manufacturer or even older toddlers who gain basic understanding of cause and effect and the rhythms in the sound.

I wish the string was longer than mere 9"". The center of the wooden handle with string is about 12"" long in total. That is too short even for average height toddler. Kids do not pull toys with hands stretched all the way down. Most of the time he pulls the string at chest level which renders the toy hanging in air instead of being a pull toy.

It is very good for a sit down play and can engage a toddler if he gets interested in music. Otherwise, as a pull toy it may not work successfully. With the current price range, I would expect that the designers in the company must have thought through this aspect.

So, I unpackaged the thing and prepped it before giving it to our daughter for Christmas. Comes with Ryder figure and ATV. The ATV is pretty sturdy and good on carpet. But, Ryder's legs are rather fragile. The Patroller trailer section only holds THREE (3) medium-sized vehicles while closed. BUT, you CAN stuff an entire set of Paw Patrol figurines inside the Paw Patroller when closed IF you use figurines, racers and/or an appropriate combination of figurines and mid-sized vehicles. The cab of the truck holds 4-5 figurines. (Five if you really pack 'em in, possibly plus 1-2 removable packs. )

Here's what we stuff in our Patroller (while still being able to close it):

Two medium-sized vehicles with riding figures (Ryder & ATV, and Everest & snowmobile);
Two small racers (Chase and Zuma);
Two figurines plus their detachable packs (Skye and Rocky);
Two figurines with spring-action packs (Robodog and Tracker); and
Two figurines with other features (Rubble and Marshall). Reasonably sturdy Paw Patroller. Makes noise. Comes with battery. Rather large. Opens to reveal a second floor.

They do not retract inside the robot and instead stick out. It's not a big deal. The robot is about 10"" tall, but you can raise the head to make it about 11"".

The robot includes 3 cheap AAA trial batteries. I immediately replaced them with Alkalines. They are accessed from the bottom of the robot, and a screwdriver is required.  The power switch is also on the bottom. Options are: Off, Play, and Trial. Dialogue is triggered by pushing the robot's power pack on the side. Push it once, and it says one the robot's popular phrases. Hold the button for a few seconds, and it will go thru all the robot's dialogue. If I counted correctly, there are 15 phrases.

My wife got this and was overjoyed to begin putting it together. She found the instructions a bit frustrating at times, but had it put together in a few days with no help from me, and she's never really done anything like this before so she was surprised that she took to it so well (she really just wanted the finished product but seemed to get really into the building process from my perspective).

There are extra parts that come with the model, and the finished product is mighty cool (though a bit subdued in color, but that's Destiny for you). When you are done you'll have a nice block model to display but I wouldn't recommend ""playing with it"" unless you want to see fragile broken pieces all over your house.

Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form.""

The kit includes what you need for eating & drinking--plates, napkins, cups and plastic cutlery, as well as the decorations--tablecloth, small centerpiece, balloons, streamers and curling ribbon. Oh yeah, and 12 candles!! My tablecloth is the cute panda table cloth, not red like the photo. It's actually much cuter and matches the plates and napkins in design. The whole setup looks great, buttoned up and complete.

In my experience with birthday parties, if you were having more kids than 8, it would be more affordable and less wasteful to supplement this set with extra plates & forks than to buy a second set. And most kids don't ever touch their napkins... Don't forget the hand wipes though, always good to have on hand.

This set is so useful and saved me a trip to the store, time and gas. If you got this stuff at Target, it would be so much more expensive too.

You also use the one night ultimate Werewolf free app with this, that narrates the game for you as you go. You can customize it on the app as much as you'd like, including music, the voice, and you can decide which characters to activate during the game.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I am not reviewing the game. It's the same Chutes and Ladders it's always been. Rather insipid for anyone over the age of 6, I'd say. No strategy, just counting.

What I will review is the board, graphics, and pieces. This is a 70's retro design. I haven't played the 70's version (or at least haven't in 30 years or more), so I can't comment on the accuracy. I did like the pictures - they show little morality tales. Hard-working children who do nice things are at the bottom of each ladder, and are rewarded at the top for their labors. Lazy or mean kids are at the top of each chute, and get heir comeuppance at the bottom. My son (who is 4) enjoyed looking at each pairing and discussing how and why they succeeded or failed.

That said, the board is rather busy, and it isn't entirely clear to a younger person which square corresponds to which chute or ladder.

The game pieces are sturdy, though the plastic brackets are difficult for little fingers to insert the cardboard children into. The spinner works well once you punch it through. Spinning action is easy and can go for more than a few seconds.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"From a play standpoint, this nerf blaster is one of the more fun toys to come out from them in awhile.  It has, to my mind, a bit of a HUNGER GAMES feel to it, resembling a cross bow as it does, rather than a gun.  And it's very cool that it shoots three streams of water.  Kids love that ""bonus.""  It's fairly compact, so it's great for a smaller child (7+, I would say) to run around and have some good, clean fun.  Nerf blasters generally feel relatively sturdy, but I have to say, this one feels even a bit more substantial than usual.  Good stuff...5 star fun.

But minus 1 star for the rather silly marketing.  The use of the word ""Rebelle"" (yes, a feminized version of Rebel) is silly, and even borderline sexist.  It's done in pastel colors, so of course only girls will like it.  And the packaging only features girls.  I'm just not sure this makes great marketing sense, and I'd like to think if I were running Nerf, we'd find a way to start making ALL our blasters / soakers appealing to both genders.  But this one is SO clearly marketed to girls that I can't imagine many boys in the toy store demanding to own this item...effectively eliminating nearly half your market.  Silly.",0

Although I'm not using this for toys, it really works well for those of you who want a storage unit for beads, jewelry making supplies, etc. I can fit my tools, beads, cords and more.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old loves it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for as long as we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for as long as we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his legs go thru, and sometimes even leans backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toys to the sides where the canopy snaps on/off. He really loves the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hands to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"We did Christmas a week early with one side of the family, and this was literally the ONLY toy (besides paper and boxes) our VERY active 21-month-old played with at all, and he sat with it for at least half an hour in one sitting.  It took him several tries to figure out how to get the coins into the slots and get his fingers out of the way.  It would admittedly be easier if they were open slots to drop into instead of having to the circles that barely fit the coins, since clumsy toddler fingers make it a bit difficult, but he eventually figured it out.  He's a toddler, though, so he doesn't make it every time, and it sometimes frustrates him.

Some things you might not be able to see from the photos and description:
>The coin slot at the top drops the coins into the coin return on the left.  You can watch the coin slide down via a ""track"" in the back.
>The yellow display at the top is actually button that changes the ""display"" (it's just a roll with images on it) every time you press it.

Unfortunatly, like most games, once you play a long time and master the skills asked...there is little left to do.  The biggest drawback on this one is there is a store you can go to, to buy items for your dog after you earn coins throughout the game...well, my daughter went and bought out all the items as soon as she had the money to do so...then kept going back to the store and realized, they don't restock. So then she stocked up on like 50 bottles of shampoo, water, and dog food :)  Cute, but then she got really frustrated that the screen was really useless at that point and really never needs to go there again.

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"This dollhouse is a complete pain to put together alone. It would have been a much easier job with 2. Think awkward two finger screwdriver holding while suspending a floor with the same hand and using a tiny allen wrench with the other hand. I only had one hole that had poor pre-drilling, so compared to some of the other reviewers, I felt lucky. After the 2 1/2 hour construction, it seems like it will be a nice dollhouse. It seems good and sturdy. The ramp for the garage will likely fall off regularly because of the way it attaches, but its not really a essential element anyway.

Update
3 months later... I am leaving the three star rating.  The garage door ramp has never fallen off like I expected that it would, it doesn't attach very strongly, but the house doesn't get moved around all that much either. My son loves this house, and its played with daily. No amount of adjustments ever made our elevator work smoothly. It got stuck all the time, and I removed it entirely. It was bulky, awkward, and impossible for my independent 2 1/2 year to operate on his own.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I am a special educator and purchased this product to begin teaching one of my students to complete jigsaw puzzles.  Most jigsaw puzzles on the market contain at least eight pieces whereas this set includes four different four-piece jigsaw puzzles.  The limited number of pieces make this product a perfect tool for introducing jigsaw puzzles!  I will continue to use this product in the future, both for my students and my own child.

I have removed one star for two reasons:

1.  The illustrations on the puzzles leave a bit to be desired.  I think that brighter images would be more interesting and motivating for young learners.

2.  All four puzzles are within one board (with a frame around each).  I have found that this is distracting and confusing for some children.  I think this set could be improved by separating the puzzles onto individual boards.

One more note:  This may be considered a pro or con, depending on how you intend to use the product.  The outline of each puzzle piece is drawn onto the wooden frame beneath it.  This may serve as a helpful prompt for some children, as they can match the shapes of the pieces.  However, if you are a teacher or therapist who is measuring independence, this feature may be problematic for you.

All of the parts lined up perfectly (a few other reviews said they didn't, so I'm thinking the ones that didn't weren't assembled correctly).
The furniture that came with the dollhouse is also very sturdy and well-crafted. The lamp (which lights up) has a timer on it which helps with battery life. The house itself stands nearly four feet tall - it's really big! Compared to the flimsy plastic and cardboard Barbie doll houses for close to the same price (been there, done that, lasted a month before it was destroyed by light play!), this dollhouse is a hundred times sturdier and just plain superior.

This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else.

In the box, you get the Rainbow Dash, a pair of dough scissors, and 6 very tiny cans of Play Doh in purple, pink, green, yellow, blue, and orange. I did like that the Rainbow Dash has molds built onto it, but they are very hard to get the dough out of, such is the case of the dough extruder on the top of Rainbow Dash's head.

The problem with the extruder is that you can't fit that much dough into the hole and when you push down, the door keeps popping open and when the ""hair"" comes out, it isn't in a continuous flow because you have to keep stopping to add more dough, so it ends up breaking off. Pretty much a bummer for my daughter and we rarely use it. I do really like the scissors and we use them even without the pony and can use the raised designs on them to make impressions in the dough. I also wish that the dough cans it came with were larger because once you mix the colors in the extruder for the hair, it eventually turns an ugly dark color from repeated use of the dough. Lastly, the wings keep falling off of the pony. The idea of the pony is cool, but the execution is quite flawed.",0

Both of mine had 5 puppies so we were excited about that. Each puppy has a hard vinyl head with a soft body and a pink or blue bow around it's neck to determine if its a girl or boy. The puppies are about 4"" long and Sugar is about 15"" long. My niece's actually had a preemie puppy which was really cool! She was excited that there was a runt in the litter that was slightly smaller than the rest. I do wish the stomach hole in Sugar was a little deeper to accommodate all the puppies a little better but they do fit back in though it's a tight fit. They are very expensive on here and can be found cheaper at Target or Toys R Us. Simple but very fun toy and hands down their favorite gift this year!",0

The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons.

The camera, video recorder, and voice recorder are actually his favorite features. I cannot compare this tablet to other LeapPads, as this is the first one we have owned, but we do love it.

We did have an issue with it freezing on us once, but we're able to reset, and it's never done that again.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.

I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.

The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.

The small animals/food for the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response.  The purpose of the toy is for the baby to ""feed"" the small animals to the pelican.  The child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine motor skills.  The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own.  In fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the ""right"" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican's belly.  There is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails or a play yard - at least according to the directions.  Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step.

I should back up a minute.  This game involves you (or your kid) drawing cards that tell you to do something, and you get points for doing it.  There are some ""props"" you have that you can put together - a fishbowl, a cake, etc.  The cards give you instructions like take 3 giant steps or hop 4 times or walk around the stick (that's the big yellow thing you see here) all while holding one of items on your head, on your belly, etc.  My niece is a funny kid, and she liked doing the steps.  She didn't care about the points or whatever, which is good because I didn't understand the game completely anyhow.  But that might be the point.  It IS Cat in the Hat, after all.

Here is the general idea:

First, get a group of people wanting some social fun
Second, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are)
Third, start with someone called the ""jusdge"" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are)
Fourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.

The person who is the round's ""judge"" tosses out a card that is a descriptor.  Let's say that the word is ""Hot.""  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a word that embodies ""hot.""  One player might toss in ""Marylin Monrow"" and another might toss in ""The Sun.""  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!

This is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.

Note: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Majority Rules Card Game by Flat River Group is an interesting party game on an original premise. The rule is pretty simple. Players pick five candidates, real or fictional, at the start of the game. The chairperson then picks a question card from the pile and reads it out. Players vote for the candidate to whom they think the question is most applicable. The majority wins. All players start with 10 points each and would bet 1-3 points based on how confident that they would win the round. Most of the questions are edgy and ludicrous. How fun the game would be largely depends on the initial selection of the five candidates and how the players would go all out on a debate and defend their votes. If you have a good mix of candidates and a group of imaginative and outspoken players, the game is gonna be fun and awesome. If not, you will very soon find the group ready to move on.

Although this may be a fun and ludicrous party game, some of the questions presented tend to be adult only (sex related). As such, I'm seriously doubt that the age 14 and up rating from the manufacturer is appropriate.

The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the pieces are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, gives a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel.

Another use for this board: if you are looking at games online (such as at itsyourturn) or studying go books to demystify some of the concepts having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc.",0

However most of the time when you get it home, it either breaks, you lose pieces, or it just doesn't work as well as it should.  The Candy Cyclone does come with a lot of easy to lose parts, and not a great way to store them.  The most amazing part for me is that when done properly, this thing actually works.

Couple of things we have learned when using this.  If the back of the toy is open at all, the crank will not turn (this is to ensure safety I presume).  If you put a huge chunk of play-doh into it, it won't work.  You have to make thinner logs, and then feed it into the machine, which will then make little balls roll down the track.  If you stuff a lot in, then you're going to be opening up the back trying to get play-doh out, which is quite annoying and hard.  You can then take these little play-doh balls and use the stamper to turn them into other little things.  It's gotten a lot of us from our daughter (who is 2 1/2) and also her cousins, (4-6) who also spent lots of time playing with it.

It came without the suction cups to attach it, but I have  a textured tub so it  probably wouldn't have worked anyway. One of my sons has played with this pretty frequently, just sitting it on the ledge of the tub. He mostly pretended, because for it to work it has to be partially in the water. The floating gup that came with this was total crap and grew mold inside it, so I had to throw it out in the first month. The roller ripped in the first week, so out it went too. The rest of the unit has stayed functional, so we kept it. I am careful to squeeze the water out of it until no water squirts out after each bath use. But finally last week,  I noticed the blue tubing looked funny. I cut it open and it was growing black mold inside it. So I cut off the tubing and had to pry the plastic shower head off to get it all off. I then told my kid he could play with the housing like that since now water won't collect in it to grow mold. It is a fun toy, but designed very poorly for emptying. It will grow mold, no matter what you do..... it's just a matter of time.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Once my daughter saw this at her 3rd birthday, she was not interested in anything else. This helps teach fine motor skills and my daughter caught on right away. She's doesn't quite understand to go from hole to hole in order - she wants to skip all over the board. Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child.

There are pictures on both sides of the board and the board is sturdy. The animals that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some cons that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the holes are NOT smooth so when the lace goes through the hole, it gets frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter loves this and it keeps her occupied for 30-45 minutes at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever. She loves the pictures and the wooden (rather than cardboard) pictures are perfect so we can get a lot of use out of this. Hope this review helps!",0

If you are looking for a regular monopoly game, this is not it. You can play it like a regular game,  but that is not the intended purpose, so I would rather have the original version if I wasn't going to personalize.  I think this is a perfect gift for the one person that loves Monopoly.  We own the dot com version, spiderman, electronic, regular etc.

My boys have already personalized the cards.  Their dad is very kind and sweet and always jokes that he will ""drop the hammer"" if they don't stop whatever it is they are doing...The boys made him a card that says dad dropped the hammer, go directly to jail.  That is just one example of the personalization of cards.

See the video for the inside of the box, as well as the pieces. I thought this would help so you could see exactly how you personalize it.

Pros: Fun twist on Monopoly

Cons: Not great if you don't want to personalize.  I don't like the four folding board.  They always break! No small labels for the properties or the corresponding pieces on the board.

I was not initially that excited for this game, and once I saw exactly how you personalize it, I am really excited to complete the personalization and give it to my husband for his birthday!",0

Second, I tried the propeller guards on and spun the propellers by hand and one for the propellers would rub against the guard. So I tried charging the battery and was going to fly it without propeller guards, landing skids, and without the camera. Plugged the battery in and the drone never got power, no signal to the transmitter either. Tried calling their customer service (which was found on groupon) and they ask to send an email or leave a message. First I tried wrinting an email and after a week I never received a response, then tried calling and leaving a message and after 2 weeks I never received a response. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! Beware of this hoax company. I will now try and google for company webpages before making any further purchases, regarding drone manufacturers. The cherry on top, after handling the body of the drone, the company name smeared from the palm of my hand. Very cheap and not worth the money. This would have been my 5th drone to play with, I have also built my own drones as well. Never had any other issues with other quadcopter companies.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I bought this for my 5 year old, and he LOVES it. Let's start with the good:

1. The pictures on the dice are fun and great for a Mario fan.
2. This is a great game to help younger kids who are learning to add and write numbers. It is also good in that it helps teach strategy.
3. Adults can have fun playing as well since we remember this game from when we were young.
4. Everything fits nicely in the question mark box when you are done playing.

The not so good:

1. I had to coat the dice with clear nail polish as a preventative measure to keep the graphics from wearing off (thank you to the reviewer who suggested that)
2. The score cards are really small and for a little kid trying to write numbers, it can be hard to fit the writing into the space allotted. But I have to say that I don't think the score cards are all that much smaller than the yahtzee we used to play. And, as someone else pointed out, the pages are easily scanned and enlarged. The only problem there is that larger papers would not fit so neatly in the box.
3. There is a glaring typo on the scorecard. Not a big deal for adults, but confusing for a five year old.

Overall, for the price, you will get hours of enjoyment from this game. And even if it is not the most durable or well made game, for under 20 dollars, I think it is fine. Especially if you have a Mario fan!",0

However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

I'm worried about the cars being damaged because my son is a bit rough with them and there seems to be no way to replace just the vehicles if this does happen.

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"The Bloco product consists of a few cutout sheets of foam, as well as some connectors. I'll grant that it's clever, and the dragons are fairly neat when fully constructed. That being said, I'm not a huge fan. First of all, there are a large number of pieces - 230 doesn't seem like that much, but many of them are small and even hard to find. My 6 year old was overwhelmed, so I had to piece the things together. Moreover, I suspect that the instruction sheet would be a bit much for a 10 year old, working alone to interpret - let alone a 6 year old. If you look at the picture of the kids on the Bloco page, they still have their baby teeth - so they're marketing to younger kids. The foam itself is, by and large, pretty thick and durable, although there are a couple sheets of thinner form that easily tears as well. In some cases, however, removing the smaller foam holes and pieces can be difficult. Regardless, separating the pieces in the foam sheets took a good amount of effort, and assembling both dragons took around 90 minutes - for an adult. The toy itself was OK. If your child likes Legos they'll probably like this as well. In my case, once the novelty of the newly-built dragons wore off, the toy was largely forgotten.

First off I sent for the ants which cost another $5.00 for S&H right through the website. It took 10 days to receive them, keep in mind if you live somewhere it's cold or too hot you will wait longer. After receiving the ants, only one dead one, I followed the instructions closely. First making 4 starter tunnles with the tool and then cooling down the ants in the fridge for 15 minutes then putting them in. It took less the 24 hours and the ants started working. Each ant has different jobs. Some dig, some remove debris and some just stand guard near the lid. Someone reviewed it didn't light up well; maybe they didn't put batteries in it! Mine lighted up well! The only hard part to this is the fact you have to put the whole farm in the refrigerator for at least 75 minutes to slow the ants up to clean out the debris as they are very fast and will try to escape. I have it 3 weeks so far and lost maybe 5 ants as they do die off and do not lay eggs since there is no queen. Like any other creature sometimes they dig other times they rest.

The thing I like about this toy is its sturdiness.  If it's one thing I've learned about little boys it's that they are rough on toys, yet they get upset if something breaks.  I sympathize with the person who said the cars fall off the tracks, but my experience has been that unless you pay a lot of money and buy replicas of real trains and anchor the tracks down permanently somewhere, you will have that problem with any toy that runs on tracks.  Also, the set is chunky enough and easy enough to set up to not frustrate small children whose fine motor skills are not that well developed.  Therefore, the toy helps give children confidence that they can do something themselves.  And I think that any toy that lets children use their own imagination when they play is very good.  There are far too many toys out there that don't do that.  Everything is already imagined for the child.  Not only are these toys not helping children, they are downright boring to play with.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.

Each player gets a ""financial statement"" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"The Princess guitar is a pretty in pink starter guitar for small hands and short arms; however, there are some reservations that other reviewers also mentioned.

My 7 and 9 year old girls want to learn guitar.  A full sized guitar is hard for them to manage.  This is more their size.  It does need constant tuning- probably the biggest drawback.  My girls are learning off ""Alfred's Complete Kids' Guitar Course"".  It starts with single finger chords: C-G7-G then a 3 finger chord D7, which are fine on this guitar since it only involves the high 3-4 stings(mostly G-B-E).

For full 6 string strumming, there's usually a string that needs to be tuned or one can just ignore it, and let them strum and play to their imagination.  Our strings have not broken yet.  They have covers for the nuts and stickers to id the open string(which eventually fall off- not a biggie).  It's opening is small and the resonance very limited.

I find our girls use this for play, pretend and simple practice.  For better sound, they mess around with our electric quitar on a mini-amp.  For their age group, it takes time to get use to pressing the strings down and toughen and strenthen their little fingers up.  It's all for fun and they're advancing quite well at their own pace.

1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far.",0

They are very durable, and I highly recommend them to any collector.Great product, very realistic.My son loves this toy. The kids were excited about it, but it was a bit small.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"If you're a parent/grandparent with a youngster just discovering the ""Cars"" movies, I can tell you that my husband and I have had a blast collecting these small, 1:55 scale Mattel models for our grandsons.  You definitely need a strategy if you plan to collect, since their are just SO many of them.  Hard enough trying to just figure out who all of the characters are!

Giuseppi Motorosi is the Italian-speaking pit crew chief for Lightning McQueen's primary rival, Francesco Bernoulli, in the Cars 2 sequel, both of them sporting the colors of the Italian flag, and they were actually sold together in a 2-pack last year (if you're just starting to collect, might want to check the 2-pack out in case it saves you.)  According to the cute little bios they put out on the characters, Giuseppi is designed as a 1966/69 Alpha Romeo Duetto, a former racer himself until he had a major accident at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track on the Curva Parabolica (the final challenge of the race), and has now teamed up with Formula Race champ Francesco.  This - as with all of these little models - is very durable and nicely detailed... just be careful - if you get one of the crew chiefs, your youngster's bound to want them all!

This year Giuseppi is part of the 9-piece WGP Pit Crew collection, along with Alex Machino, Max Schnell's pitty (be careful about adding the racers' little forklift pitty characters too... there's a bunch of them!), Otto Bonn, Austin Littleton, and 2-packs of Manual Maniez/Bruno Motoreau and Jeff Gorvette's Pitty/John Lassetire.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I have the original game which I love and I thought that I'd buy the other continents for 2 reasons:
1.  others collect all the games so there must be some reason to want more of basically the same game.
2.  I wanted to use it to help my son learn the main places in africa (we used the original one to learn where main towns in the US/Canada were)
and my opinion?
re: reason #1...There is one added dimension, which is fun, and of course a different map that has a lot of cities that I'm unfamiliar with so it really twisted my brain, which is good, I guess.  But overall, I'm not sick of the first game enough to really need a second similar one yet.  If I was in the mood for ticket to ride, I would have just as happily played the first one....
re: reason #2...Although my son over time might become more familiar with some important cities in africa over time and have a basic idea where they would be, I feel that knowing which country they are in is very important and the lines showing the different countries are not there.  Also, many of the cities are ones that I don't feel he NEEDS to know, and finally, it's only the bottom half of the continent.

end opinion: I like the game but wish that I would not have spent so much money on a game that didn't really fulfill my needs.  I wish that it was all of africa, with countries identified, and only the most widely known cities in all of africa.",0

If I had known how great these cups were, I'd have bought them at the beginning.  I've tried every brand out there, and these are by far my favorite.  They do not leak if you take the time to tighten them properly, and I give 10 stars to the spillproof parts...all others I've tried are impossible to really clean properly, and you end up having to replace those parts repeatedly if you lose track of a cup and have it get yucky.  I love these cups because all of the portions of the spillproof apparatus come completely apart so you can sterilize all the parts sufficiently before reassembling the cup.  I put the parts in a compartment of my dishwasher and use the sanitize cycle.  My son rides a school bus with me all day, and he was in the habit of slinging his cup of milk to watch the dribbles land on the walls and seats.  This made for a huge stinky mess to clean up.  He would do the same thing on long car trips in my personal vehicle when he was bored.  I'd have little white dots all over my windows and seats.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My husband and daughter put this Titanfall building set together and it turned out impressive looking. Our Atlas Titan man is able to stand (fairly large dude) and we are able to do simple poses with him. This model really does look cool when it's all together. Kids age 8 or 9 should be able to put this together, especially if they have had some experience with K'NEX building kits and/or have some help with assembling them. We've had other kits in the past and have enjoyed working on them together. Older kids shouldn't have a problem with the Atlas building set.

The downside of this set is that with some of the parts, they were difficult for my daughter to snap together and she is usually pretty good at that and has snapped together parts that I was unable to fit together in the past with other model sets. This was a little frustrating for her. The model does have some cool features like the little man inside and the usable weapon that I was shot with a number of times, but isn't strong enough to put out an eye.

All in all, this a cool kit that does require patience and a little strength-younger kids will greatly benefit from and really enjoy some help with assemblage. We have our Titan Man standing proudly on the kitchen table and have put him in a few different poses. The feet have to be planted evenly for him to stand and the surface he is on has to be totally even. This was a good rainy day family project and took a few hours to fully complete.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"Great theory, but poor construction.  It broke on day two after around 10 total minutes of use.  Two faults:  Poor gluing of the magnets under the alley and weak, unstable wood veneer used on the top surface of the lane......First the side magnet switch got stuck and would not come back up to the vertical position to set the pins up.  I took it apart underneath to find one magnet came out of it's circle and latched onto the neighboring magnet, blocking the triangle of magnets from rising fully to the top.  I reglued it and another one that was loose (only a string of glue kept it from popping out of its socket), and then added 2 drops of super glue to the sides of the others as well.  Problem #1 solved.  Then I noticed in a good light that the pin dots on the bowling lane were all raised slightly (about the size of a fingertip around each) and the king pin spot had a tiny crack in it.  The bumps obviously affect the roll, which is why the ball won't go where you aim.  The veneer must be very thin.  There should be a thin non-flexible substrate under this area, like a small aluminum or plastic sheet, to prevent the lower magnets from pushing the wood up.  OR, a ""stop"" installed in the plastic mechanism to prevent the magnet plate from rising any higher then the floor bottom, as without one the spring pressure bangs the magnets up slightly into the wood.  Still working on this problem.  Very disappointed.",0

Not a sleep in bed with you kind of toy, the exterior fur is what makes them charming.  Trixies mouth is open so her cute little tongue is showing, which makes her extra authentic appearing.

Trixie arrives in bright purple, pink and blue packaging with a remote control, star glasses and her skateboard.  Even her handkerchief around her neck is purple based delight.  Screams GIRL TOY.  2 AAA batteries and 3 AA batteries are required to make Trixie come to life are NOT included.

Pull one back and let it go--and it zooms across the floor easily! Thing is, my kids are older than 2 and so a little past the age for this particular toy.  So it was perfect when my 1 year old nephew came to visit and we could test drive them with him!

Huge success.  The lightweight, plush design makes them easy for him to grab and hold onto.  He hasn't quite got the zooming thing down yet, but I'm sure he'll get the idea soon enough with my children's avid assistance.  My nephew is drooling quite a lot now (teething) so the cars inevitably got coated in drool and later on in banana.  That's when the particular cleverness of these really became apparent.  The plush tops can be unlatched from the wheel base (just undo the velcro) and washed off without the worry of getting the car mechanism wet.  And while these are certainly an appropriate toy for a one year old, I wouldn't likely leave him with the cars without supervision (just in case a wheel could be pried off), but we can take the car base off and let him play with the plush tops all on their own!

A great toy, and a great gift.  For parents and gift-giving friends who want a toy that's fun but doesn't require batteries and won't send everyone crazy with repeating sounds and lights--this might be just what you're looking for!

The game consists of a small, compact box, making it great for travel.  The pieces are carefully packaged inside so that they won't get lost. This will be great for all our trips and camping trips, and doesn't take up much space in a backpack or suitcase.

You pick a puzzle from the book included, and then use the game pieces to solve the puzzle - both in 2D and 3D!  The puzzle pieces consist of textured balls that are connected in a variety of configurations and colors.  The texture made it easier to get the pieces together without them slipping around.

The challenges are tough!  I love that there are a variety of puzzles to choose from, and I found myself having fun with this game, giving myself a little brain workout!  My daughter is almost 8 and we worked together to finish the puzzles.  She had a lot of fun with this game, as she loves puzzles and challenging herself.

This is a great game that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.  You can play it on your own or work with a friend to get the puzzle done.  This is a fantastic addition to our game shelf and I'm sure will get a lot of use for years to come!

He loves monkeys, so this toy is perfect for him.

While I like learning toys, sometimes you just want a fun toy to play with.  This one accomplishes both - it is really fun and there is an opportunity to learn colors and improve fine motor control.  The inside gears are in the same colors as the flashing lights.  The outside gears are in similar colors.  You can play match the colors or you can mix them up on purpose.  I also noticed that the little balls that come with his other toys can sit atop the spinning gears and the balls spin, too!  Add to that the gears and knobs are just the right size for his one year old hands and he likes to chew them as he is now teething his last two canine teeth (he's already got 14 of his teeth) and the gears seem to hit just the right spot for those last two.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware.

The Melissa & Doug sound puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They help their growth and development with motor skills, problem solving and general thinking. Oh yeah, and they are super fun! My older kids have always liked puzzles and Jax is no different! Even though this is for 2+, he immediately started trying to put it together. He doesnt quite have the logic and reasoning to get the fit right but he sure had fun trying and big sister Paige helped him! As with all their products, the quality is good and durable. Lots of puzzles are flimsy and don't last long but these are thick wooden pieces with little red tabs for easy removal.

When you lift up or put down the piece, it makes the animal sound. I love that I can also teach Jax what sounds animals make while we do this together.

The Melissa & Doug Sound Puzzles are the perfect gift for little ones. They will think of it as a toy but as moms we know, they are learning!",0

The ""play"" box is a nice size, and the ""play"" box is a good size. The size is perfect for me to play with.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"After the problems with the rights for the 1966 Batman TV show were fixed, they finally released an action figure series.  I have been waiting for a figure of this Batman for decades.  Now I finally have one in my hands, and I'm unmistakably pleased (but not in a filthy way, just pleased).

Before everything, as usual, ignore the first production picture and just go straight for the pictures of the figure in the box, or the customer images if you want to know what the figure really looks like.  I'll give you a hint: it looks amazing.  The detail is wonderful.  Not only they perfectly captured the look of the series, but the figure has very good articulation too.  And while it's almost invisible in the pictures, the utility belt has the classic bat emblem too.

Like all the other ones in the series, it comes with a stand and a collectible card, with some artwork of Batman on the front and part of a Batcave wide image in the back, which is completed with the other cards.  The figure is perfectly able to stand on its own, since the feet are large enough and the cape is thankfully made out of light fabric rather than heavy plastic.

Like the other figures, this one has no accesories.  Which is kind of a shame, since Batman had a lot of crazy gadgets in the old series.  I'd have gladly paid double if the figure had come with a small can of Shark-Repelent spray.  No matter.  The figure on its own is a great accomplishment and it's very well crafted, so it's worth 5 stars.",0

He's 4 months old and has already started playing with it. I highly recommend it for any age. It's very easy to put together and is very durable. The only thing I would say is that it does break easily. I've found that it is really difficult to get it together. We bought a wooden dowel and it broke easily. The pieces are made of thin plastic. I've had no problems with this being broken. My grandson is almost 3 and loves to play with it. It's very well made and really fun. I would recommend this to anyone. My son loves this set and the only thing I don't like is that it's made of cardboard and it's very hard to assemble. It's hard to put together and it's not going to stay together for long.

Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"We had this gun for more than a month now. We purchased NERF guns in the past and the automatic feature sounds very appealing and fun. Right out of the box (after inserting new C-batteries which were purchased separately), the first time the new darts were placed in the transparent clip, one of the darts clogged the gun. There are times when my son can shoot the entire contents of the clip (18 elite darts - we ended up buying additional elite darts from Amazon - I believe this is a good deal:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Dart-Refill-Pack-30-Darts/dp/B0083TXZVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nerf N-Strike Elite Dart Refill Pack (30 Darts)</a>), and other times when the gun gets clogged. It became a habit to watch my son excited to use this gun, only to have it get clogged, and get him upset. I would say the major fault with this gun is clogging: about 30-40% of the time. That's way too much, and I believe the reason for it is the design of the flexible darts. In addition, I would say the use of C batteries may not be the most inspired option. You have to unscrew the battery holder, and I believe that the batteries can drain unnecessary fast, since there is no shut-off button. Otherwise I do not know how to explain why we had to replace batteries 2 weeks after relatively limited playtime.

I was undecided to give this product 3 or 4 stars. I settled on 4 since the gun itself is great fun when it works. I find the issue to be with the flexibility of the darts. Once they get bent, the chances for clogging increases, and even new darts can get stuck and stop the fun.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).

It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.

Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"So where do I start?

First off, I need to make sure I get the correct size so I can fit the gun in the right position. This is a very large gun, so it's not really a problem. If you are going to use it as a full sized gun, it's a good idea to get a larger size. If you are going to use it for a kid, it's a good idea to get a larger size.

Secondly, if you have a kid who is going to be a little bit older, you need to be careful not to break it off. If you have a kid who is going to be a little bit younger, you may want to take the gun apart. This can be difficult for them to handle, but it's a good idea to put the gun back in the right place.

Thirdly, I need to get the correct size for the gun. I've had some issues with the paint being a bit on the gun and the gun's head not coming off. I'll update this post if I find a better solution.

All in all, I was very happy with this purchase!  It's a great toy!  It's very nice quality, and it's perfect for little hands!Very fun.  Will buy again.This is a good toy for my 2 year old.  She loves to play with it.",1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.

Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.

Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.

In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol.",0

When Batman rides on his back, you can push on a button under Cyberex's tail that makes a top part pop up and you can push a button to get red discs to shoot out at the 'bad guys"" which is a big hit with both boys, and is easy enough for even my 3 yr old to work on his own. It springs together nicely after you are done shooting the discs out and stands up without falling over or tipping like some toys do. You can push Cyberex's head down and tilt him up or down, which helps with aiming your shooting discs. We like that the Batman symbol is the end of Cyberex's tail, tying in Batman to the dino looking toy! Over all, it is very well built and has become one of the ""go to"" toys in our household for the boys. We recently had a party and some boys, around the age of 5, were very drawn to it immediately!

I plan on wearing it in a sling occasionally and making a little sling for her as well so she can carry it.  It's a great size for her.  While the mouth isn't really open for feeding, the lips are parted enough that she can sort of pretend to bottle feed it.  It's not super soft plastic and so the legs and arms are pretty stiff and solid.  The eyes remain open, which is kind of a bummer.  My daughter is not big into dolls, so I just try to mention it now and then and get her to rock it or feed it.

I'm really not a fan of the smell.  I think it's too strong.

I've got 6 Star Wars Build & Play models for my 4 Y.O. boy so far. I think this one is one of the first models in the Build & Play series. While all the others I've got have both ""light"" and sound effects, this one (and the other X-Wing with black & orange camo) has sound effects only. The sound effect is also not as cool/laud as some others (TIE fighter sounds the best IMO). Nevertheless, you can't skip this one if your kid wants a Star Wars Build & Play model I guess. One good side of this is that this one has a little higher chance to survive in your kid's hands, compared to the Level 2 X-Wing from Revell. The Level-2 X-Wing lasted a week or so (My son is extremely cautious when handling his toys) before its super thin laser cannons shafts were bent and some parts fall off. I don't see any advantage of buying Level-2 X-Wing over this one. This Level-1 model looks as good as the level-2 X-Wing.

Compared to other Build & Play models, this and the other X-Wings are exactly the same except for the color. The difficulty is on the low side. If you want to introduce this series to your child before the recommended age (8+), this can be a good starting point. You may also want to try TIE Fighter or Millennium Falcon.

The recommended age for this toy is 6+, and I'd say that is probably about right. Many 6-year-olds will be able to assemble this toy, though some will struggle with it. Unless you want to assemble it yourself and keep repairing it yourself, you had better not give this to any kid younger than 6 years old.

The biggest drawback to this toy is that it doesn't come with a single WWE action figure. It would take two to make it a ""complete"" toy, yet it doesn't even come with one. To me, that's just absurd. Every playset needs to come with one or more figures to populate it, and when I see manufacturers pumping out stuff like this that forces parents to purchase more stuff to even make it fun, it really grinds my gears. The action figures that are made for this playset run $20 each, so you can plan on spending an additional $40 on top of the cost of this set to even make it ""playable.""

I've bought severeal WowWee products over the years including the Robosapien and the Roboraptor.  This is the first one that I had to download an app to fully appreciate-- It says in the product information that it works without the app but given the limitations I'm not sure that I would buy this without access to either an ipad or a smart phone.  My ipad is a bit outdated and the app would not download to it, so I downloaded it to my Samsung III phone which worked ok. I think this is the oldest Samsung that it would work with by the way.

Like all of the WowWee products I have bought it does not come with a battery so I had to supply them.  It also has a compartment for the batteries that requires a tiny screw driver. I don't know if they plan to upgrade the app but it doesn't do a lot of different things-- makes noises, the face on the screen changes, and it can run through a simple routine of turns and straight movements.

A ten year old lost interest in it pretty quick but a 7 year old was more intrigued.  The most damning statement came from a 53 year old who said it was like a Furbee but more annoying.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Our son received this toy as a gift when he was born.  We were a little worried about putting toys in his crib, but soon got over that when we realized how well he reacted to Pooh and the music!  Yes, it is a little loud for a lullaby toy, but the volume has never seemed to bother him -- he sleeps right through it.  When he was still in the infant stage, we used the remote control constantly to restart Pooh from the comfort of our bed if our son hadn't fallen asleep yet.  It's great that the remote allows you to select your starting point: the toy comes with three ""stages"" of songs, moving from singing to just music to soft music and bird chirps.  We would replay the softest music when the baby was nearly asleep, the singing when he was still fussy and needed more distraction.  He is one year old now, and he has learned over time to turn it on and off (push the cloud on the pillow).  We know he's awake when Pooh starts singing!  Quite often he hasn't quite had enough sleep, and he turns Pooh on, curls up with his blanket, and goes back to sleep.  The little light under the cloud is a great bonus, since it gives the baby a little ""comfort light"" when Pooh starts to sing (the light fades out as the music softens).  Our son LOVES this toy -- we couldn't imagine bedtime without it!  ONLY drawback (and it's negligible)--he loves it SO much that we really go through the AA batteries!

The activity guide gives lots of great information about each of the animals in the set.  It gives information like why the animal is endangered, where they live, and special characteristics.  It also gives discussion starters and a couple of activities.

I opened it up and my son immediately asked questions.  He started to name the couple he knew.  I corrected or helped with the couple he didn't know.  We talked about the animals and a little about each.  I told him they are all endangered and of course he asked what that meant.  We talked a little about them, but mostly he just likes to pretend play with them.  He was pretending today that the manatee was swimming really fast and then he broke his tail so he was swimming slow and then it got better and he went fast.  Such a 4 year old play game.  There is so much play that can happen with these animals.  Pretend play is such a valuable skill to learn and why not add in some other learning.

Well, I unpacked it from the frustrating packaging one night and left it on the floor, and the next morning he found it while I was making breakfast. By the time I came over to see what he was doing, he was opening the sides up and taking he cars out, stacking other things in there, closing it up again, and running the truck around. There's even a little ramp that comes down the back for the cars to come down from.

The only downside for me on this one is that the design seems a little more finicky than most toys we use at this age. When you're closing either one of the sides of the carrier or the ramp, their are bits on either end of it that need to snap in. To get both, you either need to realize that you need to push in on both edges of the ramp and on both ends of the each of the flap down sides, or you need to apply pressure pretty exactly in the middle -- so with a young child, it's super common for just one end to snap in and the other end to still be unlatched, which in this house sometimes means that the doors flop back open when you hit a bump. It's not the end of the world, and I'm sure he'll figure it out as he gets a bit older -- but it's occasionally frustrating for him now.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Dozen Doubloons is a pirate-themed card game for 1-4 players. As the name suggests, there are doubloons involved, and the number 12 is important. The first player to collect a dozen doubloons is the winner.

This game is attractively packaged and easy to play. To collect a doubloon, players must create the number twelve using cards in their hand or available cards on the table. Wild cards and 12 cards can give players an easy doubloon, and block cards can be used to hinder an opponent.

Dozen Doubloons has quickly become a new favorite among my children. I think one of the bigger draws for them is being able to collect the doubloons, but I know they also enjoy how easy the game is to understand while still challenging them to think and make decisions. Its not always easy to find a game that both of my children enjoy, so this game is definitely appreciated in our house.

As a light game to pass 10-15 minutes, I think Dozen Doubloons is a decent choice. It has a quick set-up and is easy to play. The game leans more on luck than strategy but still offers players various choices to make on their turn. Rules for playing a solitaire variation are also included on the rules sheet, and that is a fun choice for someone who has a few minutes alone and wants something to do.

As a parent, I also have to appreciate the educational value of this game. Being that my children are 5 and 7, they are both working on their addition facts, and the task of figuring out which cards can be used to add up to 12 has been of benefit to them both.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"The Lego Connoisseur Here, Reviewing the Snowspeeder.

True to my beliefs, we picked this up for $25.00 at Legoland.  Less than $0.10 a brick!

Believe it or not, we bought this for a three year old, hey it was Legoland and we were in the moment!  Probably should of known better all things considered...This Lego set feels very strong when built--durable even, through many battle simulations it has survived harsh environments and many gun shots!  Until his other brother shot it down with a fanfare of no other.  Not recommended for little kids since most battles end with a request for a rebuild, much to parents dismay.  However the largest one (ahem...) loves this Lego Star Wars Set.

First, it is a relatively older set.  I remember it when I was boy.  My friend had it (and all the other ones too).  Tons of fun, decent instructions to go along with it, but not quite as user friendly as the newer more, ""step by step"" instruction designs.  This felt more true to the old movie than many other sets without as many custom parts as those tend to have.  Plus Luke, with a light-saber is always awesome.

The few complaints I have is related to the cockpit...There really isn't enough room.  I wish they had built it up a little more so that the fighters could sit up straight.  I also which that Luke had some spot to put his light-saber in the cockpit.  I think the spring-shooting darts are a bit too sensitive, they went off several times without much input from me.

The playset comes with a pretty Cinderella figure, the carriage that has molds built into it, and 3 jars of Playdoh. We love that the carriage has molds you can press the Playdoh into to make the fairy god mother, her dress skirt, Jaq, Gus, birds, and a pumpkin. The Playdoh presses easily into them and comes out easily as well without ruining the mold you just made and it's easy to peel away the excess Playdoh around it. Her favorite is that the wheels of the carriage have brick imprints and Cinderella's slipper to make a stunning walkway for Cinderella to walk on. The top of the carriage is really neat that you can press it down and make pumpkin vines. The carriage itself is gorgeous and colorful and doubles as a working rolling carriage for Cinderella to ride in as well as for making the molds.

The plastic carriage is thickly made and very durable to handle even rough play from younger kids. My daughter also likes to reenact the story with the molded figures and so it can be used for dramatic play as well. She also uses her other Disney Princess figurines to interact with Cinderella, though we don't put Playdoh on them. I love the creativity and old school fun this toy offers without any ritzy technology like most toys these days.

The only downside to this toy is that it's hard to clean the Playdoh out of the vine press, but that's to be expected. It would've been nice to have a cutting tool included too.

For starters, and probably most importantly for people who had the old one, there is a major improvement in the voice recognition.  Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version does a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone.  Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all.  This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she gets frustrated it still responds about half of the time.

It's definitely a gimmicky toy, so if your little one is looking for something more secure, an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/old-fashioned-locking-diary/dp/B00NYAGMQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">old-fashioned locking diary</a>&nbsp;may be a better bet.

The journal book itself is small, but my 7yo took it out and keeps random notes to and from friends in there instead.  When she pressed her friends to try to get into the journal, it says ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of ways to keep secret notes from their nemesis: little brother.

Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which means it's never really secure.  Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secrets from her parents anyway.  ;-).",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Amazing toy. Bought one for our 7 yr old niece and played around with it. Seems to be the hotness of 2013. But let's not lose our heads, here. It is merely a reconfigured Nerf Blaster. Instead of a trigger or a pump, you pretend to release a string. Aiming is more luck than skill. Comes with five whole darts.

If they really want to learn about archery, you'd be better served buying a simple 'starter' bow and arrow set for about the same price. Teaches them a skill AND not to shoot their friends! My dad taught me to shoot when I was young and it is still a fun and relaxing hobby for me. This will not teach them anything, but dang, it's fun!

Some advice on the price:
-This retails for abouts twenty dollars. All my local retailers were sold out, and about two hours after purchasing it from Amazon the price here more than doubled. I see a lot of annoyed shoppers giving this one star over the price and that's bad form. You don't like the price, don't buy it. Don't mislead other shoppers about this great, fun product because the vender is gouging. Amazon isn't always the best price. I've seen a few 'hot' products sold for much cheaper locally (Target, WM, TrU) and while Amazon is great for most holiday shopping, in this case, at this moment, they aren't. ALWAYS remember to price check!
-Don't be suckered into buying the 'girly' refills, the ones that match the colors of the bow. They cost more than twice the price of the regular orange ones! (Now THIS is some sexist gouging!) Kids don't care what color their ammo is and not everything girls touch needs to be pink. Save some money and pick up a pack of standard Nerf refills.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection...

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid.
Newsflash!
Neither are today's kids.

I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around.

I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be.

However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here.

I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers.

I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think.

Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER!

It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children.
Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self.

It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter.

Play with your child when you offer your child the toy.

There is lots to do with it! We like it very much.
I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring.
I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading!

Toys_and_Games_5,4,CG,I bought this for my son for Christmas.  He loved it.  He loves to play with it and plays with it often.  He is 3 and loves to take it out of the car and put it in the trunk.  He loves it and is still having fun with it.  It is a great toy and I would recommend it to any child who is interested in learning about animals.My son loves it.We bought this for our grandson. He loves it. He uses it to play with his little brother.  He's very happy with it.We bought this for our 3 year old. She LOVES it. She loves it. It is a fun little toy for her and we love to play it with her. She plays with it for about an hour. It is a little hard to pull it down as she is a little too young for it. It is hard to lift it down and it doesn't fit. It has a lot of pieces and it is hard to see all the pieces in the house. She loves to push the blocks down and move them around. It is hard to put it back on. It is very small so it is not very big. It is very soft and nice quality. It is a good size and it is a good size for little hands. It is a good size for a 4 year old.This was a gift for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He also plays with it a lot and plays with it for hours,1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Boss Monster is a light card game for 2-4 players, that takes about 30 minutes (give or take depending on experience and number of players).

In this game, each player takes control of a boss from an 8-bit video game RPG. You must build a fiendish and deadly dungeon, and lure heroes into it with the kind of loot that they like, in order to brutally murder them. You use Room cards to build the dungeon, and Spell cards to aid you (or hinder your opponents). If your dungeon is strong enough, you will kill the heroes and collect them as ""souls"" (points). If the dungeon is too weak, the heroes will break through and wound you. Any boss who takes five wounds is killed and out of the game. But the first boss to survive and gain ten souls is the winner.

This is a solid, fast-paced card game. The theme is fantastic and I love the look of the cards. In fact, everything about the game just screams ""fun"" at first glance, right down to the parody art of famous video games and other pop culture figures. In fact, why the game succeeds is because the theme is tied so strongly to the mechanics, and they blend well, even though it's a very simple game.

It does have some faults. The rulebook could use some work and does not clarify certain basic rules. There's also something of a runaway leader problem (in our game of four, two of us were WAY ahead of the pack by an early point of the game). It's also a game that is already starved for expansions...replay value is questionable.

However, the game itself is very enjoyable for now, and I plan on playing it much more. Kudos to the Brothers for their successful Kickstarter, which amounted to a fine game.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"I researched different models of this toy and found the instructions for the G1 were very confusing and difficult.  I had to get a solid model of the G1 to work, and that was a pain in the butt.  The instructions were very vague and confusing.  The G1 is a 2.5"" toy and has a ""plastic"" head and a ball joint.  My kid had to use a different set to get it to work.  I had to have it flip over to work on the head.  I am very disappointed with this toy.  It is a great toy for a 5-year-old.  I would recommend it.This was a gift for my son.  He has been playing with it for a month and has had no problems.  It is sturdy, but very small for a gift.  I wish it had a larger size.  I would have given it a second chance.  It is very small for a small child and the size of the toy is just too small for him to play with.  I would give it 5 stars, but it is a gift and we would not be buying it again.  I will be returning it.I have a lot of interesting science toys and this is one of my favorites.  I love the fact that this is a'real' science toy.  The magnets are nice and the toy is fun to use.  I like that it has a magnet on the bottom which keeps it from sliding",1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

All in all it's a fun little game for the very youngest of gamers at a cheap price.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"I am so glad that this set came with the instructions for how to make a small starter set.  If you want to get a solid starter set, you'll need a lot of patience with this set.  It is a perfect starter set for any beginner to learn.

I love that it comes with a variety of things to make.  It is a great set for any beginner.  This set has a lot of things you can do with it.  You can create your own basic shapes, shapes, and colors, and you can also add colors to your own projects.  The kit comes with a variety of tools, shapes, and tools that you can use to make anything you want.  I also like that the materials are recycled.  I also like that it comes with a variety of different materials.

It is a good starter set.  I love that it is a perfect size for preschoolers and their families.  My 6 year old likes to make small blocks and pieces.  I also like that it comes with a wide variety of different materials.  I also like that it is a great starter set for a young child.  I would recommend this to anyone who is into building.My daughter loves this.  She has been using it for a while now.  The pictures are a little blurry, but I thought it was worth it.  The packaging is pretty cute.This is a nice toy, great for a rainy day or afternoon.  My 3 year old",1

Well i changed to 1 star after lastnight im very disappointed with this drone after flying for about two minutes about 15 feet up it decided to drop from flight for no reason. New batteries in controller and fully charged in drone. I checked everything, no damage. Continued to fly until battery ran down every thing was ok. Took it out tonight, paired ok got it up 10 off ground everything ok so i landed it. Too it out to my driveway, pushed video button and  then pushed one button take off, it goes up and up and up, I had no control working of any kind it went up about 40 feet and drifted into a tree about 70 feet away and now my drones stuck in a tree 40 feet in the air. No way to get it down, thats too bad it only flew well a few times. By the way I'm not new to drones, I have three others that work fine. UPDATE 8/3/17 CheerWing seen my review and the problem I had with the drone. They decided to send me a new drone free of charge, surprised the heck out of me. So I decided to give the stars backfor great customer service. I couldn't ask for better. Thank you again CheerWing. I will be doing more business with them in the future, they treat their customers well.  ( 8/18 Thank you again CheerWing for great customer service!) 10/14/17 still flying the CW4 couldn't ask for a better drone, no problems thanks CheerWing!",0
Toys_and_Games_5,1,CG,"I've long been a fan of Star Wars and the movies, but I didn't think this one would be so well-made. The details are fantastic, and the paint is very pretty. I was expecting a smaller figure, but it was perfect. This one is still fun to play with and a must have for any Star Wars fan.I got this for my son as a gift. He was very interested in it, and it is very cute. He loved it, and I can't wait to get it for him. He will be happy with it.Great product!My granddaughter loves these!  They are great for bath time, but the kids do not like to leave their toys outside for long periods of time.  I bought these for my 9 year old for her birthday.  She had a little trouble with the small pieces, but she loves them.My granddaughter loved this doll. She was not really into dolls in general. She was just a little scared of the kids and didn't really like the idea of her dolls being made of wood.  The doll was very cute, but was more expensive than I expected. The dress was a bit too small for her. The back of the dress is very loose and doesn't fit well.  She has a lot of hair that will eventually get tangled up and fall out.  The dolls are very cheaply made and look pretty. The dolls are hard to put on the doll's back, but I would not buy them again.This is a fun toy",1
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.

""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.

Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.

""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept.",0

My grandson will love it!This is an adorable, cute little party game. My son loves to play with it. It has a variety of ways to interact with the kids. My son has found it a good mix of humor, fun and some great cards to play with. I like that it does not require any assistance from the kids. My son has had a lot of fun playing with this, but I have no doubt he will enjoy it in the long run. My son is a big fan of Thomas the Train. He plays this game every day. He plays this game at least once a week. It's really fun for the whole family. The game is easy to learn, and I like that there is a lot of replay value. It's not like a game of chess, where you have to win every game and then lose. It's more like a game of musical chairs, with a whole host of rules. It's a great game for a family, and a good way to learn how to count numbers and numbers.",1
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I really thought this game looked silly at first - but once I got to playing it, it's amazingly fun! You get All Three new Episodes of the movies with this game!

The little lego guys are absolutely adorable, and when ships blow up, they disintegrate into their component lego parts. Lego fans will be thrilled to see little lego flowers, lego swinging doors, and much more. The game is pretty true to the story line, which is funny in and of itself, watching the famous Star Wars scene done lego-style. You jump, shoot and light-saber your way through the scenes. You get to use a variety of characters, and each character of course has his or her own special talents. There's a lot of coin-collecting, secret-finding and bad guy bashing. There's an optional two player mode which is great - someone else can grab a controller, play for a while, then drop out without any penalty at all. There's a regular story mode for going through the movie plotline, plus a free play where you can randomly switch between various players to solve some of the trickier puzzles. There's a good deal of replayability as you go back searching for the treasures, and trying to unlock all of the cool extra features. This is really perfect for the munchkins, but adults may find themselves playing it after the little ones are asleep because it's actually rather fun. I was impressed with the graphics too - the little legos walk as you might imagine they would, the floors shine with great reflections, the textures are just very nice. There isn't much sound besides the Star Wars themes going on in the background :)

I didn't have any problems with crashes at all, and if I ever do get bored with it, there's a line of people waiting to get it from me next.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,4,CG,"The car is painted and looks real, with the instructions included.  There is a button that activates a two-way radio.  There is also a plastic ""turn"" button that activates a speaker.  It does not work on the car.  This car is very loud.  It is very difficult to control the car, especially when you have a high speed car like the Ferrari or the Ferrari Supercar.  The buttons on the car are very loud, and the car is not very stable.  You have to constantly pull the button to turn it, which is very annoying.  The car is very noisy.  The buttons on the car do not stay in place, and the car is very unstable.  It does not work on the car at all.  There is a 3-way radio, but it is not active at all.

My daughter is very happy with this toy.  It is very durable.  It does not break easily.  My daughter is 4 and has had many of her favorite cars for many years.  This toy is very durable, and very easy to use.  I would recommend this toy for any child who loves cars and trains.My son is into all things science and he loves the little sets.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This toy is amazing - and is in no way for kids only!  It was intended for my youngest nephew who does in fact adore it and carries it around with him, but his older brothers who are both teenagers also couldn't stop for lack of a better word ""playing"" with it.  In fact, he had to fight them off for playing rights!  When I first received it, I unboxed it to make sure everything was alright and you do need to put on the sticker decals according to the diagram on the box, and I've got to say that even for me as an adult seeing what it all does so I could explain it to him was actually quite fun for me too.

The Millennium Falcon itself is much larger than I imagined, making it even cooler for kids, and it's fantastic that they also included a Hans, Chewie, and R2D2 figure rather than making you buy all the people separately (though there is plenty of room for extra figures from the movie to buy on your own for even more fun).  There's so much you can do inside the Millennium Falcon too.  There are trap doors, a Jedi training station, a movable ladder, seats for your figures, blasting rockets, and a cockpit you can open and close.  For the adults and teens it was just a tad disappointing that the cockpit only sits one so Hans and Chewbacca can't both sit in there together like in the movies, but the youngest didn't seem to mind at all.

This really is so much fun for the young and young at heart.  If you were a huge Star Wars fan back in the day this is a must to get for your kids - and that way you can play with it too!",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"When I selected this Barbie doll and horse play set (based on the upcoming movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-Her-Sisters-in-A-Pony-Tale/dp/B00E95AEBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie & Her Sisters in A Pony Tale</a>) to try, I didn't realize it was remote controlled (it appears to be the only Barbie horse so controlled so far), so this function came as a complete surprise, and once I figured out that it needed 4 AAA batteries not 2 (mentioned on the box of course but surprisingly not obvious in the battery installation instructions), it functioned exactly as it was supposed to.

Controlled either by the Barbie doll remote control or by forehead button when Barbie is riding (though depending on the play area you might be able to bounce Barbie's arm activated infrared signal off the wall and make it work that way), the horse walks, stops, bows, and recovers from the bow as intended.  In our experience the horse walking worked well on smooth flooring and thin carpeting, but not (obviously IMHO) on thick carpeting.  Restarting the horse after it enters sleep mode is a little tedious (holding the button down until something happens) but better than the alternative of running the batteries down.

I can see some definite additional play possibilities if and when they start making more of these remote control horses, especially if they speed them up a bit and add unicorns so that they can be made to ram into each other.  (When I mentioned this to my 9-year-old daughter, she raised an eyebrow, folded her arms, and said, ""Daddy...."", then picked up the horse and stalked off.)

Maybe it's another one of those differences between boys and girls things.

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"3.5 stars
This is skimpy set. When it is available and I can check it against the actual retail price I may update my rating. But otherwise meh. You only get round track, 3 cars, the controller and some removable decorations--it does have cool noises. I have a Marklin Z scale and an older O gauge by Lionel that I use during christmas time (obviously in different locations because near each other would be pure craziness) so I understand the train prices are more expensive than people realize, especially Engines. And this is a pretty neat and fun for little kids Engine. The Caboose is Bobber style and ok. The engine is a Lion chief Thomas the Tank and is very obviously the highlight of the set. The chirstmas hat makes it that much cuter. The remote is battery power and includes announcements and sounds but no smoke (that i could tell.) The middle freight car is nothing special and feels especially cheap, though to be fair these often do I think in part because of the open top design. The track diameter when fully spaced out is a little over 3 feet. The track is your standard Lionel rack and self stabilizes with the plastic base. With another car and 4-6 pieces of straight track this would be a neat 5 star set. As it is it just feels a little cheap. Lightweight, lots of plastic, not many cars and very small completed track.

I think most kids will love this set, and they can set it up themselves, and make train announcements--my nephew sure did--but I think parents need to understand what they're getting or they'll feel they maybe didn't get their money's worth. Its not quite the grand experience of trains of our youth. Its more plastic, less track, less cars, were bigger and we had to pay for it!",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"This is very light for a Feld game.  I've played other light Feld games such as Builder's Duel and The Speicherstadt but for the most part his games tend to be meatier/deeper experiences.

In this game players draw 3 cards each turn.  Each card has 3 possible uses and players determine which card is going to be used for each of the three functions that turn.  One will be used to give the player a special ability, the other to get a resource, and the last to move an animal track marker up.  In between the second and last action players also put an explorer on a board in order to surround and collect animal tiles.  These tiles are the main source of points in the game.  The game lasts until the animal track markers are at a certain level and the player with the most points wins.

I typically really like the mechanic of cards being used for multiple different purposes and having to choose which role to fit each of your 3 cards in each turn presents a lot of opportunity cost decisions that make this game, despite being reasonably light, also reasonably deep and engaging.  There's a little bit of competition and reading your opponents as everyone is playing in the same space and especially with more players there can be competition for certain aspects of the game.  That said, the game is a lot more interesting with more players.  It is fine with 2, but each player can tend to focus on their own thing and there is less interaction.

The accessibility is a great boon for this game, this is a game that is quick to get up and running with almost anybody and because it is still reasonably engaging and deep you don't sacrifice that in making a lighter game.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"These are very nice container boxes for the price (which at present is about $10 for a set of four). The build quality is pretty good  the containers are thick enough that they don't bend or rack if you twist it which gives me confidence that they will stand up to a good amount of use (and abuse). The lids are thinner, but still of good quality. The lids snap on with a firm snap so you know it is sealed. I am, however, concerned about the longevity of the lid snaps since they are all-plastic with just a crease line to serve as the hinge.

I filled one with various items and gave it a torture test to see how it would stand up. The lid remained firmly attached even after I dropped it several times from desk height to a tile floor, and tossed it around while it was in a laptop bag (in other words, a normal usage pattern for people such as myself who have a tendency to drop things often). No cracks or splits in the plastic either.

It is sized more for a kids-size meal than an adult. The overall dimensions are fine, but you cant fill up the compartments to the top of the lid with items such as pasta since the partitions do not extend to the top  they only extend up about 1.25 inches. That puts a limit on how much you can fill each compartment (provided, of course, that you want the food to remain contained in each compartment).

On the plus side, they are very attractive. The base is crystal clear and the lids (which come in four colors) are transparent. It would look just fine for both a school lunch or an office lunch.

Not perfect, but well worth considering if you're looking for an inexpensive set of lunch containers.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I would actually give mine a glowing review had it not been for one stiff wrist joint, hand broke off leaving the peg in the slot. His ankles were fine and his paint job was good, so I'm all the more annoyed at myself (I even thought ""Gee, it would suck if I broke the wrist and got the peg stuck in the slot ...""). Aesthetically speaking, it's quite good, though they over did it a bit with the top-heavy look, true, they were pretty barrel chested with tiny legs on the show, but this is just slightly more exaggerated, it's not a deal breaker at all though. While articulated enough to get a fairly wide range of poses, it's still hampered a bit because the range of the joints is limited a bit by the bulk of the figure, only to a small degree however. The only real ""flaw"" I felt there was with it in its own right was the lack of a swivel joint at the hips (a two way ankle join would also have fixed this). The stand is a bit of a joke, though it serves its purpose. Due to the width of his waist it doesn't actually hold him, but it works enough to prop him up with the cape draping over it.

Oh, he also comes with optional capes, couldn't for the life of me figure out how to switch them. Finally, when I broke the wrist I stopped caring and yoinked the head off (I was afraid before there was some other trick ad pulling the head off was requiring no small amount of effort, so ""I didn't want to break it""), that is definitely how it's meant to be done, it's a thick rubber-y plastic on a ball and socket joint (though you only get left/right movement), so I hope that clears up some head scratching.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,3,CG,"This kitchen is adorable! Here's what I love:

- The kitchen is a little large, but is so small that it's not too small for the little kids to take in. - The kitchen is in a large storage case. - The kitchen has a lot of storage space. - The kitchen has a matching plastic table with several pieces of furniture. Overall, I think this kitchen is pretty good. It's easy to clean, and the kids love to play with it. The little kids will really enjoy playing with it, and it's a great addition to their kitchen. I'll be keeping this review as a Christmas present for my kids. I have been playing with this at work for over a year now and I've had no problems. I have a little girl who loves it and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. It's not quite as big as I thought it would be, but it's still pretty darn cute. I don't think it's going to hurt my kids, but it's a good size for a little kid. It's well made and it's very well made. I received this item as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. Very cute. My granddaughter loves it.",1
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"This is a cute idea, but it's not all that much fun.
After the novelty wears off, there's not much to it.
This is a miniature race track with these cars that you charge up, then let zoom around for a few laps.  It's kind of neat.  These teeny tiny cars - seriously there are as big as my thumbnail, have batteries and motors in them.  The set needs two double-A batteries to work; and you ""charge"" up the little car, then let it go flying around the track.  It's a little klunky, but kind of neat.
Once the track is set, you place the car in the charging area and press a lever.  The lever sticks these two prongs into the back of the car.  The back of the car has 2 little metal pieces where the contact is made to charge the car.  Mine didn't work.  I had to fiddle with the wires in the back of the car but finally I was able to make contact.  When the car charges, it makes a little revving noise which is kind of neat.  Then you release the car, and it zooms around the track a few times.  It's cute.  It's also boring.  The novelty of one car wears off quickly.  This set claims you can race other cars, etc, but you only get one with this set.  Plus, it's not like you can make a bigger or different set with this one.  It's pretty limited in how you design or create a track.  If it came with two cars, you could ""race"" them etc, but alone, it's pretty dry stuff.
My nephews like to tear stuff up and re-design their own tracks but this is what it is - a single track.  At least it doesn't take up much space.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"Comparing this to the more expensive ones, the materials are pretty thin. There is a tiny bit of a clang around the front of the car, but you can't really see it that much.

The only thing I would change is the size of the trunk. The car is slightly larger than the one I got it for, but I think it is a little too big. I just wish there was a bit more space for the engine.

This toy is very well made. I would recommend this toy to anyone.I love these for our little ones!  We have been using them for a few weeks now and it has lasted for hours!  We love the colors and the size and the size of the wheels.  I can't wait to give it a go!Grandson loves it!  I have no problems with it.My son loves this toy.My son is a big fan of Thomas and this is a good addition to his collection.  We have already had this set for several weeks now and he loves it.  The only complaint I have is that the box was very small and the back of the box was not attached to it.  It took a couple of weeks to get this back together, but it is still a great toy for a small child.  My son loves this toy.  He has had to take it out of the box and put it back in the box.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"We were lucky enough to receive the Fisher Price Little People City Skyway from Fisher Price for free to check out. My kids (3.5 yer old girl and 17 month old boy) were absolutely enthralled when they saw the box. I could not open it fast enough and then, I could not build it fast enough. Building took some time but overall was easy enough (just need a screw driver). Everything is labeled nicely. My husband says they need to include an extra screw (because he lost one).

I will admit, I was skeptical about this toy. We had seen it in Target previously and my kids were attracted to it like moths to a flame. I remember thinking, ""ummm, not going to happen. One trick pony toy."" However, I'm happy to report, I was super wrong. My kids LOVE this. They've been playing with it everyday, multiple times during the day.

Pros:
-It's huge. Like nearly as  tall as my 3.5 year old huge. Definitely taller than the boy.
-It comes with two cars, Koby and Tessa.
-You don't have to wait for one car to finish before you start the other (essential for the sharing challenged).
-It fits other Little People cars.
-You can slide other cars or things down the ramps (like Octonauts for example).
-The cars can go to three separate exits and they can either go down the ramps on their own or the kids can switch them.
-It really does inspire imaginative play with a fueling station, stop light, crane and gate.
-It spans the ages nicely.
-No batteries!!!!
-Sturdy. Doesn't fall over easily and seems like it could take a pretty good beating at the hands of children.

Cons:
-It IS big so if space is limited this could take up precious space. If your kid is really into cars though, it's totally worth it.

All in all, this is worth the asking price. Would make a fantastic holiday or just because present!",0
Toys_and_Games_5,3,CG,"This is a great little toy. The pieces are sturdy and the pieces fit together well. The only thing that I don't like is that the pieces have a ""turn"" sound and that it's difficult to turn in the direction you want it to go. I like the fact that the pieces don't come with a magnetic tag, which can be a little annoying since you can't use magnetic tags in the toy. I think it is nice that the pieces fit together nicely and that they can be placed into the toy without having to pull them out.This is a great game.  My kids play it daily.  They do not enjoy it too much.  It is a fun game for younger kids and adults, but my 3 year old likes to play it and I like it.  It is a little hard to figure out the numbers of the words.  We are not really sure how many times the word ""my"" is used, but we think it is a lot of fun.  We like that it is not hard to figure out the numbers so you can take it on a long trip, and we do enjoy it.  It is not too complicated to get going, but it is not too easy to get moving.  It is a good game for the younger kids, but for older kids it is just a lot of fun.I bought this for my daughter's 3rd birthday and she loves it! She is obsessed with the piano and loves it! It's a great size for her hands and her head! It's really cute and she loves",1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Schleich's North America Giant Volcano with T-Rex Playset is a beautiful piece of art and very instructional toy. It's immaculately detailed and textures are exquisite, especially on the dino's. There are so many details to point out and explain to your little one as you play together and I'm surprised by how much my little 5 year old loved this set. The bones were especially cool to see.
That said, Schleich's Giant Volcano Playset is a vinyl monstrosity that is a chore to put together very cumbersome to store anywhere. The material is soft vinyl and just weighs a ton. It came in 5 or 6 pieces and held together by these tiny brittle pegs that was an utter nightmare to assemble. Just a very poor design choice of material. Definitely bad if your little one is prone to throw things - each of the pieces from this set is hefty and will cause some damage. many of the highlighted features don't work too well or was embarrassingly underwhelming - ie: the ""exploding wall"" the wall pieces had to be assembled into the nook and pressing the button pushes the pieces over - kind of. The flaw here is that the pieces are so heavy, the notch of plastic that knocks over the wall can barely budge the pieces and they pretty much just slide down. The tree snaps just hasn't worked yet. The roots don't stay agape and the spring snap doesn't really do much. About the only thing that does work is the Dino jail gate and even that contraption seems over engineered.
Flaws aside, the set is very beautiful but alarmingly over priced at almost a hundred dollars. Ouch! I get it - it's vinyl and hefty and very detailed - almost like a model kit but $100 is just too much for such badly engineered play. However, it is great if you're a Schleich fan.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This is absolutely a brilliant,entertaining and challenging game,The price is reasonable and will stand up to years of use, either in a home or school-type environment
.However,care must be taken around small children who want to place things in their mouth,as several pieces are small enough to be swallowed. Also you have to be careful not to lose any of the pieces because any loss would render the game worthless. The quality of the game is excellent and the booklet of rules, puzzles and solutions is also excellent The booklet has a coil binding,so it can lie flat,the paper is very high quality as is the colored printing and it will withstand a lot of use. However the solution symbols are very tiny ,requiring lots of light and good eyesight or glasses.
 There are 60 puzzles ,grouped in 5 degrees of difficulty,Starter,Junior,Expert,,Master and Wizard.,each having 12 puzzles. The game resembles Rush Hour..but on Steroids. I would rate the difficulty level as 2,4,6,8 and  10 as the puzzles go from Starter to Wizard. For example the most difficult Starter puzzle,# 12 requires 26 moves to solve,the Expert puzzle # 36 requires 32 moves and the Wizard puzzle # 60 requires 123 moves to solve.
 So,there you go ,suitsable for all ages and puzzle solving skills.
Even younger ones will have fun playing with the game ,by ignoring the given puzzles and simply spilling out the pieces and trying to place them all in the tray,.
 I give this game 5* even though the packaging is not very good. First the package is about 3 or 4 times larger than it needs to be,the ""window"" should have had a heavy cellopane cover ( you can make one),and it should come with a cloth bag for storage or travel ( something else you can make.)

Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"Who wouldn't love this patriotic little toy, the only thing I didn't like is the tiny one.

I had to get a replacement. The box was a mess. I sent it back and it still looks like it's broken. I wish it was a little bigger. The box is a bit smaller than I expected it to be. I wish it had a little more space. I just wish there was a little more space for the sound effects. It's very small. Overall it's a great little toy, but I would buy it again for my grandchildren.

I'm glad I found this seller, because I was disappointed in the quality. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he was a huge fan. It is a great toy for an 8 year old. My son is a little older then I thought, but he loves to play with it. I don't recommend this toy to anyone but my grandchild.

My son loves this toy. My son is 4 and has had it for about a month now and it's been a hit! He's played with it more than any other toy I've purchased. He's also been able to play with it all the time and it's been great! I think it's perfect for little hands! I like that it comes with a small zipper that makes it easier for him to take it out of the bag and out of the bag. The zipper is sturdy and a great size for a 2 year old. He's actually pretty easy to use, but he's really not that comfortable with it",1
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My youngest daughter, my niece and their friends are all into Monster High dolls, so this was a very welcome addition to the collection.  The playset is huge!  Even though the box was somewhat large, I was still surprised by the size of the finished product.  Speaking of which, it requires some relatively minor assembly.  Once assembled, it can either be used as a play toy or a large themed display case for over a dozen dolls for the types who are more into collecting the dolls rather than playing with them.  My oldest daughter collected Bratz years ago and still has them preserved in their fancy custom themed storage cases to this day.  She rarely actually played with them.  On the other hand, my youngest daughter and my niece are more into playing with their dolls than collecting, so this playset sees a lot of action.  It can also be used for both purposes.  It's durable enough to withstand hours of regular play and the dolls can be stored inside on decorative display when not in use.  The playhouse is somewhat sturdy but can be a little shaky at times and has several moveable parts, some of which seem like they may be easily broken if your child is a little too rough.  Speaking of dolls, none are included with the playset.  I ordered two new dolls so I could present them along with the playset.  It just seemed more exciting to surprise her with the playset along with new dolls instead of just the playset alone.  The girls absolutely love it so far.  It's definitely a worthwhile pickup if you have a young girl who plays with or collects Monster High dolls.  Just make sure there is plenty of room for storage and play, because  like I said... It's huge.",0

I have heard that the game is very similar to the one I played. The Clue is a great way to get familiar with the concept of the game. It has all the different pieces that you can see in the game and you can play with a group of people. The game is played by a group of people, but the game is about a group of people playing a game. It is more like a group of people playing a game. The game is fairly simple, but the basic rules are simple enough for you to understand. I think it is a good game to play with the group of people who are going to play. You can't really mess things up with the people who are going to play with you, but the people who are going to play with you will get bored of it very quickly. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good game to play with friends or family. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is not going to get bored with the game at first. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"The Mega Fun 93628 Marble Fun Run has been a delight for my children to play with. This set has allowed them open ended play to build and discover for hours at a time. It's been fun watching them work and seeing them try to speed up or slow down their marbles to get to the bottom first. It's a good set to enhance problem solving skills, spatial reasoning, and so much more!

The set comes with 105 pieces and this includes 30 marbles. There are instructions to build the run on box, if so desired. The variety of pieces vary from curvy, straight, a loop de loop, starter areas with little levers, pieces that have detachable and re-attachable wheels, and more! Some of the pieces are translucent with sparkle and the rest are solid colors. The variety of colors this set is made up of makes it gender neutral. My son and daughter ages 7 and 4 years old have played with this set on their own as well as together.

This set is well made and the pieces stay together once hooked up together. I would suggest parents to put the little levers and tabs in the pieces they are meant for. My son tried to do this on his own and ended up breaking one of the pieces. With that being said, he tends to be a little rough on things. Other than that small mishap we've had no issues of the set showing wear or breaking easily.

I would certainly recommend this set. It's great for down-time during the afternoons or on days when the weather just too hot or rainy to enjoy outside. One thing I like is that more sets can be purchased to make an even bigger marble run!

Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the ""endless loop."" They have changed the placement of the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??

Our ""solution"" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.

If Learning Resources will either correct their game board or send me the older version of the board that actually makes sense, I will update my review with additional stars, as I think it's a great game otherwise. How did this major flaw make it all the way to production?

Also, I noticed Learning Resources commented on another review recently, stating that the only updates they made to the board were artistic. That is patently false and is the difference between a one and five star game/review for me.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My in laws got this for our son who is one this Christmas. He absolutely loves it! I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:

Pros:
- it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining.
- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

First thing to replace if you like big jumps are the shocks and to go with them, 30wt oil. Trust me, the combo makes a big difference. Next thing will be the tires. The stock ones do a good job of keeping the truck from flipping at high speed turns but overall they wear out fast and need replacing. Proline has a great line of tires and woke my truck up a lot. I ran mine on a 2s battery for a long time, for trailing and bashing that's plenty quick and will prolong your parts. I did recently start running 3s and geared it up. A lot faster and I'm seeing quite a bit of wear on the front and rear differentials. The great thing about traxxas, all your parts and upgrades are usually in stock and ready to order.

My style is more along the lines of giving them art supplies and letting them create what they want, and honestly, that's what I'll always prefer for them. They really enjoy projects that have a somewhat defined end result sometimes, though, and so it's kits like this that come to my rescue. Thankfully, they still get to be a bit creative with these projects, and while end results might look similar for many children, they probably won't look just alike.

There are 16 projects within this box, with lots and lots of little pieces. There are only instructions for 5 of the projects, but really, with those instructions, you can easily figure out the rest of them. I would have preferred for each of the projects to have been individually packaged to make things easier. I have had kits like that, and they make things a breeze for this disorganized mama. This kit does need a bit more organization on my part, but it's really not that bad. The supplies are all separated into different bags, and there are even extra bags for me to divide out some of the supplies. I could turn my children loose with everything and see what they come up with, but I prefer separating each project(at least for the most part), so that my children can choose which one they want to do, and not worry about running out of supplies before all the project are finished.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I don't prefer any of the stand-alone variations to the original Carcassonne and its expansions, but Gold Rush is definitely my favorite of them.

Compared with the original:
-Railroads score similarly to roads (score double if only one tile has a locomotive)
-Farmers score based on native villages (2 points each) and horse riders (4 points each) in the field
-Mountains score the number of gold nuggets showing on the tiles
-A City tile scores 3 points for each complete connected railway
-At game's end, acquired mining tokens are revealed, gold is tallied and added to the final score

Gold Rush is challenging in a couple of ways. You only get 4 meeples, so throwing out that farmer too early will limit your options more than in the original game.  Placing one on a city tile is also risky, because you don't get it back until all connecting railroads are completed.  Also, other players can place a tent into a mountain your worker is attempting to mine, and they can mine it too (with some limitations). When you score the mountain you get all unclaimed tokens, but unless you did it quickly, there might not be any left to claim.

I don't much like the surprise victory points from the mining tokens at the end. It would be more strategic to know the value of what you have acquired as the game progresses, but that's a minor thing.  I really like the economy of decisions, in which you can choose not to place a worker, and instead take a mining token from a mountain you have claimed, or move your tent to a different tile within a mountain that contains more mining tokens.  The direct competition for mining tokens is a nice change of pace for me, but others might not like this aspect.  Overall, I think there's a slightly elevated tension in this variation of what is usually a pretty casual game, and I really enjoy it.",0

The game is easy to understand, the rules are easy to follow and the cards are easy to understand. The game is also very easy to play.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I have spent some amount of time playing with this walnut sized wonder. It is unexplainably addictive. Maybe it's the rather cool free apps that Ozobot has available for it. Maybe it's the color changing LED lights. Maybe it's the way you calibrate and tune it. The cool factor is just off the charts. I like the Ozobot Dance app the best. You place it on a space and with light flashes it programs this little beast. Then you press play and it signals the robo critter to do it's thing. It will go on top of your tablet or phone spinning, flashing and scooting along.

It must have taken quite some engineering to come up with this. To distill it for you it's sensors can detect lines and colors. It will change what it's doing, program itself and perform all of it's functions that way. Everything you need comes in the box. A couple of things to share with you: Instructions say you need to calibrate and tune it every time before you use it. But you can use it a few times without doing that, it seems if you only wait a few moments before uses it seems to hang on to it's setup. But if it's shut off for more than a few minutes you definitely need to go through the calibration/motors tune process (very easy).

It's not entirely perfect all the time during the tune process. Sometimes it seems to forget what it's doing, you just put it back in it's start position and usually it will be fine. Occasionally you will turn it off then repeat the tuning process. It's not a hassle. The whole experience is fun. Registration is free and gives you access to a lot of extras at no charge. I love this little nugget of technology. I've attached a picture with a sugar packet in comparison to give you an idea of it's true size. Sample for fair review.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I ordered this tea set last week, after reading many reviews and contacting Green Toys. I asked the company about the leaky teapot problem which was mentioned in several lower-star reviews. A company representative responded, assuring me that the design of the teapot had been changed to fix the leak problem.
It is evident that the leak problem has been fixed; it no longer has a seam around the middle of the teapot that was causing the leak problem. It should be noted that the lids of the teapot and sugar bowl are no longer interchangeable; the teapot lid is much bigger than the sugar bowl.

I love that the set is cute, made in the USA, dishwasher-safe, able to hold liquid, and came in awesome packaging (even though that only matters when you first get it, it's so nice to have the frustration-free packaging! Why can't every company package items this way?)

I originally gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because:
  The tea set seemed smaller than I thought it would be (but it's actually just right for my 2-year-old, so I actually wouldn't want it any bigger)
  The green plates are  a lime green instead of the soft pastel pictured
  The teapot lid isn't as pictured (but is now leak-free!) and isn't interchangeable with the sugar bowl lid
  While the set appears durable, there are some small flaws that appear to have occurred in the manufacturing process. My daughter tripped and fell on the sidewalk while carrying a teacup and the plastic is scraping off a little bit from where it hit the ground.
  You may need to have your toddler hold the lid while pouring. It stays on with careful, gentle use, but also falls off sometimes.
  It could be priced a little lower (say $15-$18 instead of $20).

Bottom line: Definitely worth getting, not quite perfect. I would still buy this tea set and am happy with the purchase.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"This game is a mixture between worker placement and area control.  Each turn players place their workers on a variety of different spaces that discover and populate parts of the ""New World"", collect trade goods, specialist workers, and battle opponents.

It can be compared to Dominant Species where worker placement is also used to manage the area control mechanics of a game.  I didn't really care for that game and I don't like this one much better.  I do like it a little better because it doesn't seem as abstract as Dominant Species.  The one slightly original mechanic of this game are the specialist workers that provide bonuses based on what action spaces they are placed in.

I think I just need to stop playing these older games so long after their release because I tend not to like them with a few exceptions.  Worker placement has been refined so much and knocked out of the park by so many games since this came out that this game just seems kind of bland and samey even if it was original at the time it was released.  Even the mechanic I labeled as ""slightly original"" where you can acquire different kinds of workers with special abilities has been done and done better by several other games since.

All in all this game was simply bland.  The worker placement piece, which with how much I like worker placement should have been my favorite piece, just seemed ancillary and unnecessary to the area control piece.  The special buildings you could buy didn't do anything very interesting and all of this made the game kind of bland.  The worst was that there was very little to do by the end game, especially the final turn.

It wasn't all bad though.  There are multiple legitimate paths to victory and lots of interesting decisions to make.  It's just not something that has stood the test of time.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"Monopoly Electronic Banking certainly reflects the world we live in. I don't know the last time my kids actually saw me pay for anything with cash. In this version of Monopoly each player (up to 6 players) is provided an electronic debit card. With this debit card they purchase properties, pay rent, buy houses, etc.

At first I didn't know how I felt about this money-less version. It sure was easy to set up. No more sorting and counting fake $10, $20, $50, and $100 bills. However, I wasn't sure if my kids would understand that they didn't have an endless supply of money and that how they spent their money had an impact on the games outcome, since they didn't have the money visibly in front of them.

It didn't take them too long to catch on though. By the fourth time around the board they were asking about their balances and not just buying things without some thought.  Also, they easily caught on to how to raise their balance by adding properties, houses, and collecting rent.

The banker controls the electronic device that controls all the money. They have to insert a person's card, input the correct amount of $$$s and push the right button.  It isn't too complicated. If your child is comfortable using a simple calculator they should be able to manage this just fine.

Like the original Monopoly, this isn't a quick game. You can easily spend a couple hours playing. One nice thing that we found about the Electronic version, was the ability to easily take a break from the game. Everyone's balances remained stored on the banking device until we came back to the game and we didn't have to worry about all the loose bills getting scattered. If we want to start a new game, we just hit a single button on the banker's until it resets. Very easy.

I still like the original Monopoly, but this up-dated version is both fun and realistic.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I pitched this fun device as a drone to my son, who thought it was the best thing in the world.  We took it to the local soccer field and we were off! Or rather, we were off to a wobbly start.

The Jump Jet is technically a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicle, capable of rising and descending like a helicopter and buzzing around in the air like a plane.  We liken it to Windblade, the Autobot who transforms into a VTOL jet.

The Jump Jet looks like a jet but it takes off like a helicopter, which means it ascends by drifting backward and then launching upward.  It takes some maneuvering to get this right, as it's not one helicopter blade over the center but two blades, which causes the drift.  There's even a control to adjust for this drift, but good luck using those while you're trying to get the Jump Jet to take off.

Once it takes off, there's another button to transform it (see?) into jet mode.  I was torn between shouting ""Form of...a JET!"" and making that sound Transformers make when they do it, but my kids were already nervous about flying this thing in public so I decided to keep their embarrassment to a minimum.

The transformation to jet comes suddenly, which requires a completely different set of flying skills.  Where before I was simply trying to keep the thing from crashing into the ground or to a child, now it's a matter of keeping it aloft and moving forward.

I took me several tries to get the Jump Jet to take off, transform into jet mode, fly around, and then transform back into helicopter mode to land.  By the time I finally managed it, it was out of power.

My eight-year-old tried this several times and was never able to get it, but he was very helpful in running all over creation to bring it back from the latest crash landing.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I started looking for climbing toys for our now 17mth old before Christmas & after hours online, this was my fav. I planned to buy it for our daughters big Santa gift but hesitated after reading some reviews about poor safety features...when the priced dropped after Christmas, I'd still not found anything I liked better so I decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I ignored the few negative reviews. It is absolutely perfect for our energetic, climbing toddler. She is able to climb the wall with no trouble, the slide is fast & long enough for her to enjoy, she can get a ball into the basketball hoop herself & while the potential is there with most any toy for a child to use it incorrectly and possibly get hurt, under minimal supervision, I see no imminent risk in this toy. (the concerns I read were toddlers ""diving"" through the hole for footballs to be thrown through). That particular opening in question does not hit our child in a place height wise where that is an issue. If she's standing, the hole is around her belly, if she sits, she can peek through the hole, but with the majority of her body safely on the platform, she isn't likely to fall from it. A child, if intentionally trying to dive through, coud get it through it I guess but it doesnt seem very probable. Again, I'm glad I bypassed that info and ordered anyway. I was also glad it was not quite as huge as I'd envisioned, it will be easy to move outside in warmer weather. It was also easy to put together which is a major plus!

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This is such a cute little fake guitar.  It is push button rather than anything with real strings.  You play it by pushing the button where you would normally strum the guitar and you do ""fret"" work by pushing down on the interior of the fret section of the guitar.  There is a flip section that alternates the music between electric and acoustic.

My grandson is almost 18 months old and doesn't really know who Dora is as he watches very little on TV (and then only a couple of specific DVDs.)  We do, however, play a lot of instruments amongst the family - just in my house along there are over a dozen different instruments.  He even has a small ukelele of his own at his house that he plays with.  He grabbed the Dora guitar as soon as I showed it to him and showed him which buttons to push.  He ""played"" guitar all afternoon - carrying it around with him everywhere.  He would stop and start dancing and shaking his head to the tunes or would drop the guitar to clap - and then realize that he had to play it again to make the music continue.

The final move of the day was when he put it in his pop-up castle (along with his much beloved Fisher-Price piano keyboard) where it will wait until next week when he comes to my house again.  He loved it and played with it for hours.  His smile was so big, I wondered if it hurt his face to keep it up all afternoon.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)

Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under ""normie"" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.

Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"UPDATE 1/10/2016:
Despite the poor quality of these items and the doubled price, I decided to buy some more with plans to reinforce the hilt from the inside to withstand normal play.  The sabres have changed!  The buttons now have different and LESS DESIRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.  There is one switch that has an on/off position.  When in the off position, the other button does nothing.  With the on/off switch on, the other switch toggles between on and off- pretty useless!  The saber cycles through the colors and the sounds (which are, at least, still Star Wars sound effects), so that you can no longer select which color blade you want.  What self-respecting Jedi (or Sith, or Ren, for that matter) would carry a saber which has a random color with every swing?????

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

One of the sabres arrived broken out of the box with a tiny piece of the plastic at the butt end of the handle where the speaker is located broken off.  Otherwise, these were (WERE) super cool and fun out of the box.  It goes downhill from there.  Fast.

All three failed in some way after just hours of play, one failing literally within minutes.  On two of them, a flimsy plastic fin broke loose inside the battery compartment, allowing the batteries to migrate around inside the handle, rendering the lights and sounds inoperable.  I was able to repair these two somewhat easily by unscrewing the handle and gluing the fin back in place, but the fact remains that they broke after just a couple hours of moderate play.

On the third sabre, the sound stopped working, again after just hours of play.  I have not attempted to repair this one, and have not opened the handle to see if a solder would fix it since I don't have a solder gun anyway.

Spend a little more on something that might last at least a week.  No, I would not buy this again.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"I was a big fan of the Dinobots as a young child growing up in the 80s. My favorites were Grimlock and Snarl, but Slag was the first one I owned and he still has a special place in my heart because of this. Well, the Bey-verse Slug is NOT my Slag. This Transformer is much smaller and is brightly decked out in purple and red colours instead of silver, gold and gray. As much as some older TF fans like myself may want to compare AoE Slug to classic Slag, it really is apples and oranges. That said, if you WANT a Dinobot closer to your childhood memories, do a google search for FanToys Scoria. This third party Slag looks like the original but has the articulation and poseability of a modern Transformer. It'll also set you back two hundred bucks, so this $9.99 Slug may sound better and better after that revelation

Slug (SLAG!) is a pretty easy transformer to well, transform. His modes are pretty easy and obvious to shift from one to the other. The Dinosaur (triceratops) looks fine if a bit garish. My wife likes how colourful he is and once you get past the G1 Dinobot paint scheme that is more than likely embedded into your head, you'll be okay with it. Paradigm shift people!

Robot mode is where Slag falls apart. Part of it is indeed my own preconceived notions. it's weird having the triceratops head as shoulder pads instead of a helmet for example. Other parts are just bad design. Slug's robot head is just kind of a blob amdhis front dino legs are just hanging out on his side in robot mode, making Slug look more like Shiva than a Dinobot.

So all in all, the price point is nice and when you get past the G1 expectations in your head, the dino mode of Slug is pretty decent for a Bey-verse figure but the robot mode is really lacking. We'll call it a thumbs in the middle here.",0

MyIMG_0404 students love to learn the shapes as well.  I was very excited to receive the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set from Learning Resources for review.

My students LOVED this activity set.  It was in my small group centers for a couple of weeks.  They kept asking for it.  There were a lot of things that they liked about it.  They loved that they were like puzzles, especially since the mats are the shapes of bugs.  The boys especially loved this fact.  My students loved how brightly colored the shapes were and that there were many different shapes to play with.

As a teacher, there were many things I liked about the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set.  I loved the variety of shapes that are included.  I really like that the shapes are transparent.  This way the students can easily see if they have placed the shape correctly.

I really loved the variety of activities on the cards.  Some of the activities on the cards are placing the shape where it goes, combining shapes to make other shapes, and sorting the shapes by similar and different attributes.  These are things tShapes Don't Bug Me Collagehat students are required to learn in the kindergarten core curriculum.  I love that these activities applied directly to what my students are learning in class.

Most of all, I loved that my students loved to play with them.  I loved that the students were having fun but were learning as well!

This activity set would be great to have at home.  It teaches important shape concepts and the kids will love playing with it!  I loved the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set and highly recommend it!

It is very easy to lose pieces and they fall apart with a good amount of force.  I would highly recommend this toy for children ages 4 & up.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This is a great coloring case.  It has a crayon set, a colored pencil set, and two sets of markers - pip squeak sized small markers and regular size.  As other reviews have noted, it costs about the same as it would to buy all the included crayons, pencils, and markers separately at full price.  The separates will go on sale, and so will this case.

Crayola is good quality.  The products are not light fast, so over time, pics left in windows or bright light will fade.  Colors are bright and markers last longer than dollar store products.  Crayons are the best, since many other brands are waxy and weak.  This set has washable markers, but not the washable crayons or pencils.  So, needs supervision for small children who might write on the wall.  Crayons are made in the US; pencils made in Brazil; case and markers made in Vietnam.

The carrying case has plastic shells glued to the inside that hold the crayons, pencils, and markers.  It looks all neat and tidy, and the latches hold it closed fine for carrying around.  I have not yet lost markers, but since I got this to share with a two year old, some marker tips have been damaged.  Sets drive me nuts when I start missing pieces, but that's the nature of sets.  The plastic shell on this one won't come out, which is good for a full set, because I much sturdier, but means I can't gut it easily later.  The carrying case has a minion with teddy bear on one side and a minion playing a guitar on the other.

My particular set came with two of the same color crayon:  banana bonanza.  I know this means that I'm missing a color in my set, but I'm not OCD enough to go through and look at every crayon to find out which color got left out to allow room for that double.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,"OK, so first of all, as a calendar: I was annoyed that the numbers were all out of order. This made things difficult to find. I was also annoyed that the pictures on the front seem to indicate what will be behind which door, but then they weren't accurate. Now, all that said, it was nice that each door had a compartment tray behind it, and that they doors had directions on the back of the paperboard for each one. Each bag was also labeled with its number, just in case things got misplaced.

Now, as a Megablok set: I have really enjoyed Mega Blok's interpretation of Star Trek and TMNT characters. This set is a bit below the standards set by those previous sets. You only get 158 pieces, which isn't a terribly good value compared to other sets. Many of the pieces here are uninspiring to say the least. A bush? A weapon holder? There are, at least, three main characters to be had, Shredder, Casey Jones, and a turtle who can be switched via headband between all four characters. But the figures themselves are a bit below the standards set by other iterations. The legs don't move as well, the hands pop out of the arms for some reason, and assembling them is rather difficult for a kid, and even for a grownup, due to the difficulty of popping ball joints into sockets.

For the money, I'd prefer to see twice as many character figures and a lot less filler. My son, turning five in a few weeks, did enjoy that he could put together the simpler items on his own. But overall I think this represents a poor value compared to the other superior Mega Bloks sets in the TMNT family, such as the Krang set or the jungle tank set. And compared to other Advent calendar sets, such as the Lego Star Wars one, this is a poor value as well, as that set has 100 more pieces and 9 minifigures compared to 3 here.",0

I just wish there was more to it. Great. I like that the pieces are very small and have a nice twist. The smaller pieces are nice and easy to store. My 5 year old has found the smaller pieces are difficult to put together and not as sturdy. I would definitely buy this again. Very nice item. I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas and he was obsessed with it. It's very cool and sturdy and he loves it. We had to go back to the original and put the pieces back together. It was a little pricey for a 5 year old and the price was a lot lower than we paid for it. I don't know if it's a quality issue, but it's a nice little toy.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"This is not my first Barbie Dream House.  In fact, I own this exact same one from about 3 years ago.  The design is the same, but the colors are brighter and the pictures have changed a bit to reflect the movies.

The unit shipped with two parts broken that will require them to replace the entire unit.  We'll see how they handle that and I'll update my review.  It is also missing two pieces.  And when I looked back at my old dreamhouse I found that two things that were broken on this one were broken on that one two and I just never noticed that they were supposed to light up (the fridge light and the fireplace light).

The elevator still doesn't work right.  The cords on both elevators are an inch too short to actually go through the guides, and the clip holding it on at the top comes off every time it is used.  I assume this is a problem with every unit since two units 3 years apart had the problem.

The new hottub doesn't light up like the old one did.  But this isn't a big deal.

The assembly takes about 20 minutes if you are adept at putting things together and reading VERY POOR instructions.  I have assembled thousands of things from toys to furniture to things at work and these are sub-par.  The only real complaint is the sheet of stickers which you have to put on in a very exacting way and which should have been factory applied.  There is no excuse for not simply having the machines that built the house do this step and it means that most of us will have imperfect looking finished products.

For fun I would give this product many stars.  The kids enjoy playing with it. It is big, pink, has Barbie and fits Barbie sized dolls.  I would recommend this overall but know that it is not quite as sturdy as it can be.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,I really wasn't expecting so much. The pieces are just too small. My son loves this toy. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do think is a little disappointing is that it is very thin and doesn't stay on for long. I think it's a bit too small for him to grasp on to and so far he hasn't had any problems with it. I think he will like it more as he gets older. Overall it is a great toy for the price. I bought this for my son who loves to build things and he has been doing it for a while now. It's great that he can build something that he can do with no help from the boys.

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

I received this item for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I am not affiliated with the flashing rings, the seller or with amazon, except for as a customer.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This is a review for the Disney Princess's: Sparkling Princess Series Collection by Mattel and Disney. Overral this doll is very amazing!  The doll has a golden sparkly crown, (Instead of a bow, we are treated to a nice crown) overall the crown is very satisfying, I really like the extra sparkle in the crown. Snow White's dress is gorgeous as well, the top part is blue with blue sparkles along with a red bow on the end of the top, on the top sleeves we have a puffy part of the sleeve that is baby blue with red color as well added along with it, kinda like a pattern. Next on the bottom part of the dress we are treated with a yellow sparkly color, this part of the dress is probably the most sparkled part of the dress. What I really enjoyed was the cool pictures of apples made out of the yellow sparkles, In Snow White she ate a poisonous apple, which was why this was included in the outfit. But I eventually found out in the Sparkling Princess Mattel Barbie Collection is that they also included different pictures symbolizing parts in the treasured Disney classics in the other dolls as well. The last part of the outfit is the red sparkly shoes, which stay on pretty nicely. Overall I rate the outfit a 5.0. Other than the outfit we have Snow White herself, who in my opinion is one of the prettiest Snow White dolls in the Disney Mattel Doll Collection. She has brown eyes, (Doesn't have much makeup which actually makes her look even more pretty) plain black hair, and pink lips. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was the regular looking skin, which in the story she is described to have ""skin as white as snow"", which her skin isn't pale. Actually I bought the Cinderella Sparkling Princess doll as well and found out her skin was more pale. But overall it doesn't bother me. I rate the whole thing full five.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!)

Two extra parts are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get:
(1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"I love every single thing about the Race to the Treasure game.  I love that the instructions are printed on the inside of the box so you can never lose the instructions.  (If you happen to lose the box all of the instructions are located on their website)  I love that all the pieces come in a reusable pouch, not those plastic bags that get thrown away.  I love that all of the materials are all recycled but all have a very high quality feel.  Most of all, I love the sheer genius that is a cooperative game.

Sure, it is important for kids to know what it feels like to win and to lose, and we still play games like Monopoly Junior where there is a clear winner but when there is too much ""I WIN I WIN"" going on in the house I pull out Peaceable Kingdom's Race to the Treasure or Hoot Owl Hoot.  Cooperative games require all players to work together as a team to win.  At first I thought there was no way my 5 year old would fall for this, he is competitive and loves to chant ""I WIN I WIN"".  Much to my surprise, he loves all of the Peaceable Kingdom games we have played.  My 5 year old son loves to help his 3 year old brother because it ultimately helps them both ""win"" the game.  And two winners is always better than one, right?

Race to the Treasure is my favorite Peaceable Kingdom game.  The goal is to create a path to pick up three keys and get to the finish before the ogre gets you.  The game requires some thinking and strategy of how you'll pick up the keys and get to the finish but most importantly, it requires the players to work together to decide which path is the best way.  It's pretty amazing to see kids working together for a common goal rather than plotting against one another for the glory.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Puzzles used to be something we did during our vacations at the ocean.  We liked to go in the off season to watch the storms and we'd always have a puzzle to work on.

First I had to find an open surface that was large enough for the puzzle.  I had hoped our card table would work, but it was too small.  I ended up putting it onto our kitchen table for the time being. As the description states it's 38.5"" x 29.5"", so not a small puzzle by any means.

Upon opening the box I was impressed that all of the pieces were contained in a plastic bag. When I cut it open and dumped them it to the box, I could see the quality of the pieces. These are very solid pieces, that do not bend easily and the edges were clean.

My daughter and I started putting it together the best way we know how, by doing the border first. This meant sorting through 2000 pieces, but it really makes it easier to start.  Once we had the border done we sorted the pieces by color and that is one of the things I really enjoyed about this puzzle. The colors were great! Vibrant, glossy and the different areas were pretty distinguishable.  Within a day we were at least a 1/4 done, two days later it was 1/2 done and by day four it was complete.

I think what I enjoyed most about this puzzle was the time spent sitting with my 18 year old daughter who is so busy these days, that we rarely see each other. She was so interested in it, that I would find her doing it at all hours.

Overall I was impressed with this Ravensburger puzzle and I'd recommend this one or any of their many others. They are great for your family and nice enough for gift giving too.",0

This is a nice toy, but I would not recommend it for a toddler. I would recommend this for a 3 year old or even a 2 year old. The head is too small for a toddler, but it is nice to have a little head for a little girl. The size of the",1
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible. The legs and arms, like all of the others, won't stay on. So just save your money, just wait for the real doll.",0

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I'd tried flying helis years ago and didn't have a great experience. I was not interested in spending a majority of my time fixing things when I would have rather been out flying. This little guy flew great out of the box. I will say however that you need to make sure you check this heli out before flying it. I found a blade grip screw that needed a little tightening and one of the pitch rod links was out of its slot on the rotor head. As with any heli, it should always be checked out before its first flight and never assumed the manufacturer has done everything correctly out of the box.

The V977 is responsive and does what you ask of it. Sure its a little quirky. You constantly have to be mindful of the throttle and it doesn't take much wind to blow this guy around. Now granted I've only flown in 6G mode and I'm more of a beginner/intermediate pilot. This is a great heli for taking to the park and practicing hovering in all orientations, pirouettes, circles and figure eights. I can't speak for 3D as I don't know how to yet. The manual is of course written in Chinglish. I had to get most of the instructions from youtube vids. Just make sure your throttle hold is off, your idle up is off and throttle stick all the down before turning on the tx - the rest you can get from youtube.

Make note this is not a throw away heli after a couple of flights, otherwise known as an Airhog or something similar. You can actually buy spare parts for this guy. However, ironic as it is, the heli does take quite a beating. I highly recommend someone new to the RC Heli hobby start with this particular copter, or just stick to micro helis starting out. Get a lot of practice on a sim (FS One, Phoenix, Real Flight, Accu-Sim, X-Heli or whatever), and then take what you learned outdoors without having to worry about dumping an expensive first helicopter.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,5,CG,"The Power Wheels Dune Racer (C)

""Dune Racer"" is a spin-off from the original Dune Race, which took place on a beach in the Pacific Ocean.

The Dune Racer is a 3D model of the Dune Race. The Dune Racer is painted in a translucent, dark red, and has a white propeller. The vehicle is powered by a rotary propeller, and the two engine types are a rotary engine and a rotary engine with a number of small propellers. The engine is designed to ""overheat"" and ""plow"" the sand. The Dune Racer is not only a spin-off from Dune Race, but also a spin-off from ""Dune Racer"".

Dune Racer was created by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games. This was the first of many of the Dune Race toys that Mattel released. The Dune Racer was made by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games.

The only thing that I can say about this Dune Race toy is that it is very nice and interesting. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It is really fun to watch the sand come out of the Dune Race.

I received this toy as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. It is very easy to use and very easy to learn. He also loves playing with it and he plays with it a lot. I think it is a good quality toy.Very cute.  The hair is really cute.",1
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I purchased My Pal Violet as a gift for my nearly year old niece because my son has loved his My Pal Scout to pieces. Violet has been an incredible hit with my niece.

She has short violet and white fur with a plastic light up ""dog tag"" with Violet painted on it. She shouldn't be washed in the washing machine but you can spot clean her a little. The white fur doesn't easily release stains after a while, and beleive me, she will accumulate stains because she will be played with all the time.

Violet runs on 3 AAA batteries that are held within a plastic, screwed shut compartment inside of her velcroed back. We keep a small screw driver with our extra batteries for the toy so that changing them out is not such a problem.

She comes with a USB cable because it is a customizable toy if you own a computer. I will say that the better your internet connection, the better off you will be with this toy. Leapfrog doesn't have the easiest to navigate site. It is not user intuitive and usually takes a couple of tries to get any of our Leapfrog toys customized. The sync function at the end is an especial pain.

Violet has an ""on/off"" paw, a bedtime music paw, a musical paw with popular children's songs, and a paw that makes Violet talk with customizable phrases. You can make the bedtime music play for longer amounts of time by pressing it multiple times. You can customize what children's music the other paw plays. The remaining paw is conversation for your child and it is priceless to have the toy say ""I love you, (insert child's name)"". It also is customized with info such as you child's favorite food and color. Some of the conversation can be a little nonsensical but that is part of the fun, I suppose.

If it were a breeze to program and a little more educational, I would give it 5 stars. It is a great toy though and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for any child.",0
Toys_and_Games_5,4,CG,"Zombicide features 71 28mm miniatures (Cobalt, Burgh, Gorgon, Cloth, Ironhide, Skaven, Serpent, and Anteater) and a 4 piece kit with a five piece kit.

I was excited to see how this set would fare in the hands of a family with three children. I'm very happy with the quality of this set. I wish I had known about the original Munchkin.

The box itself is very well made and very sturdy. It's the perfect size for any LEGO fan. The colors are bright and vibrant and the pieces are sturdy. The pieces are well-made and not just one piece. They're very easy to assemble and stay together. It's a very durable set.

There's a nice amount of variety in the pieces. The pieces are sturdy and have a good amount of room to go around. There are some really cool things in there.

My only complaint is that the markers are small. They seem to be about the size of a quarter. I don't know if this is a problem with the markers or if the markers are too small. But I can't say for sure.

The kit comes with a nice set of four pieces. There are two sets of matching markers.

The kit includes a matching set of 10 pieces.

It comes with a set of 20 pieces.

There are a few other parts in the kit, but they all come with the same theme.

I like that the pieces are well made and that the pieces fit together.

The kit is well made and well built. It comes with a set of 5 pieces.

Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"This tool box toy is a big hit with my kiddos.  There are so many things that I like about it but I do have two complaints.  So here is a basic pro/con list:

Pros:
-The drill/screwdriver actually works to spin the screws down and then has a reverse feature to pull them up.  It looks so similar to an actual drill/screwdriver that my daughter thinks hers is just like daddy's.  It is really neat how it works with the screws and the holes.

-The hammer and wrench work great with the ""nails"" and are great toys for my baby to hold and chew on.

-The interactive features are wonderful, they are very engaging and the little ""project"" cards are really cute.  I like the ones that have colors and numbers.

-The box itself is very sturdy, you can pull the top piece up and store tools underneath.  It is very well made.

Cons:

-The drill/screwdriver doesn't fit in the tool box for storing when not playing.  This makes no sense to me and I try to keep them together but I am sure my children will inevitably not store them near each other and we will misplace the drill/screwdriver piece.

-I love the project cards, however, the one card has 9 holes (which has numbers 1-9 on one side and colors on the other side), however, you only get 2 screws and 2 nails with the kit.  So my 2 year old keeps telling me that screws are missing because there is not one for each hole in the tool box, which you don't notice with the 4 hole card on top but you do with the 9 hole card.  So then she gets upset trying to find them thinking she has lost them.  I would love to see one screw in each color with a number on it and then you could work on matching the correct screw to the corresponding hole with the color/number card inserted - that would be a neat educational feature and then you would have enough screws for every hole.",0
