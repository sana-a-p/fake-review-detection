Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"The questions I had about this product before I received it were: is it actually waterproof or just water resistant? Is it durable? Would the material crack? Well, it really is waterproof. It uses two very heavy-duty Ziploc type strips to seal the pouch and a very strong Velcro type strip to hold the flap down so the Ziploc type strips are not allowed to open. The material is soft, flexible, durable, and not likely to crack. So, if you must bring stuff with you and you don't want them getting wet, this is a good choice.

This shirt has been the best i've worn so far - it makes me feel cooler more comfortable on the trail runs.
Please note size chart below; the information was provided by Saucony and it seems Runners like to feel larger than they actually are compared to the rest of the population; therefore, saucony's sizes will run smaller than most manufacturers sizes.

The shirt performs very well and the only problem I have is the fit - My chest size is 48 and most XL's fit nicely,, however, this XL might be maxed out to 45 or 46.
Great Shirt - poor fit for larger chest sizes.

Saucony's Size Chart for men:

Chest size:
Small:  36-38
Medium:  39-40
Large:  41-43
XLarge:  44-46

These cleats work very good on the ice.

Sizing is just right: I purchased a Large, for a size 10.5 men's winter hiking boot. Easy to put on, even outside in the cold. Fit great.

I also purchased a pair of ""Crampon Ice Traction Cleats by Rover Adventure Gear"", in a size Medium. They did NOT fit my boots, but they fit my niece's size 8 woman's winter boot just fine.

The Hillsound cleats are much better quality - the chain is stainless steel instead of basic steel that rusts, and the rubber is thicker and more elastic. But they also cost twice as much.

I did not give these 5 stars because I feel they are a bit over-priced, and they didn't come with a pouch, which the cheaper ones did.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"I like this waterproof bag.  I wear a long sleeve T-shirt, a small button-down shirt, and a small sweatband.  The fabric is a little too loose and the pockets aren't comfortable.  The zipper is a little loose but I don't find that to be an issue.  I also like the fact that the pocket is a little small so you can carry a small key, a small wallet, and a small wallet.  It's very comfortable.  I have had no problems with the zipper.

Overall, this is a great bag.  It fits my bike perfectly.  It's comfortable, and I like that it has a leather belt strap for my wrist. ",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"This product is unfortunately junk. The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils. I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend.",0

So tight I cold barely get the gun in and had an even harder time getting it out. Me, being the cheapskate that I am, took some sandpaper and oil and got this thing up and running. So now I have a $20 holster that performs like an $80 holster for about an hours worth of sanding and polishing. This goes well with my gym shorts or any time I'm not wearing a belt. Has a nice snap lock into place and since I wear mine with loose/stretchy waistbands, I wanted my draw to be loose as well. So I made it that way. Anyone can do it.

The grips on the inside of the legs work well and keep some tackiness which is great when they train jumping, dressage or are just practicing holding their post.
We have 4 pair of sand and 2 pair of the black in TuffRiders. I liked the sand as it's a shade darker than the tan and looks better while still not getting too hot in the Florida sun. The cotton spandex blend is well done and my 11 year old has already handed down her jods to her younger sister and you can't tell.

Also, it didn't seem very secure just pinching the tail to pull it out using the wave.  I have a Fox DART which has the karambit style ring on the tail which is VERY secure; however, the ring sticking up above your pocket when using the clip is pretty conspicuous.

Columbia's fleece is a bit shaggier than most other brands.  This makes it very soft and very warm, but also less ""slick"" than some others.

 A couple of notes. One is that the missing link was in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chains for 6/7/8 speed bikes.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This quick dry towel was absolutely perfect for a 12 day backcountry camping trip through Montana.  Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry.",0

This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,"I realize other people gave this item great reviews, but I believe they are incorrect. First of all it is NOT a pillow-top, NOT soft at all. The material they used on the seat is like a thick rubber tube, NOT like the picture shows. The picture looks like it would be a nice soft fabric, this is NOT the case. As far as comfort goes, my stock seat is better than this one (specialized comfort seat). Maybe the other reviewers weighed less than I do. I weigh 200 lbs and found this seat to be very hard, stiff and it became very hot in just 15 minutes of riding. it did not protect the sensitive area of my body (men know this area) and it began to hurt very quickly. I would NOT recommend this seat to anyone who weighs more than 175lbs. I returned this seat and purchased a Cloud 9 instead, which is far superior seat. I hope this review helps someone that is really looking for a comfort seat.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"My initial review of this was very positive. We like these very much. But my daughter started developing a rash above her lip where the bottle was touching. She has done this with other metal bottles without issue, even with her metal sensitivity. But these bottles must have a high nickel content or something because she is very clearly reacting to them. Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:

Easy to clean, easy to open. They have a smaller opening than many of our bottles which is nice, too. No problem with the tops in the dishwasher either (most of our other bottle tops have to be hand washed). So we are very pleased with these and bought several more after trying them out.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

This light is bright enough for  me to be seen in the early evening.  I haven't used it at night yet but have tested it in a dark house and it is very bright.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Spent a lot of time researching a not too expensive case for a Mosin M44 and an SKS.  Decided on this one and it has a ton of room; in fact added a VZ58 in the main compartment.  It is heavy but works, if I were lugging it around on my back I limit it to two rifles max,  but there is plenty of room.  No problems with quality, appears well made.  The hook & loop (velcro) straps in each rifle compartment are good and secure up to two rifles but recommend a gun sock on one or both as you cannot keep them from bumping without an additional two hook and loop straps which would require you to modify.
Shipping was quick and as quoted, however the box it came in was huge; you could literally pack an adult in it, so you know your case will arrive undamaged. :)

The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

With most dropper posts running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike was only around $900. I did tons of research, read lots of reviews, and ended up stumbling across this dropper.

So far i don't have a single complaint about this post. I've been riding it for about a month and a half now and It actuates very smoothly, quickly, and reliably. The only drawbacks to this post that i can see are the amount of travel it offers (100mm compared to many droppers with 125mm, i personally find 100mm to be plenty), the quality of the button (its not bad, the LEV just has a nicer, ODI compatable one), and the left/right saddle wiggle (which is 100% unnoticeable when riding).

I would suggest the KS eTen to ANYONE looking for a quality dropper post without breaking the bank.

-Cheap

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,Item arrived nicely packaged and in good time. I was not as excited about the item once I realized that the poles that come with it only sit in the holders. The package comes with 5 poles and 10 holders and a storage bag. You place the poles on the holder and proceed. You also get a link to an e-book that gives you ideas of how to use the product - which is a nice bonus. I was actually thinking the poles snapped into the holder but they do not. I contacted the seller and was advised that they did it this way as a precaution so the poles will just fall out if you trip or something. I personally would have preferred that they lock in but they work the same as long as you don't trip. As noted the e-book gives you several set-up ideas to use for a variety of workouts. It probably would take two sets to really get a full use out of the system. It is very versatile and made well.,0

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I purchased these to replace an old set of threaded dumbbell handles with rubber grips that were falling apart. The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much",0

Since its wider than most belts it's very roomy and I think I'm going to use it when traveling. A small money clip could hold cards and ID, leaving your valuables safe and your hands free. Kind of awesome, right?

During the day time I tend to use the black side out, but at night I turn it inside out so the pink is facing outwards. I put a couple of reflector stickers on it for extra visibility. Overall it's really well made. I can change my music through the touch screen, which is a nice feature that I can't do without now lol. The zipper is very sturdy and it doesn't slip at all during use. I've washed it a few times since I get it sweaty and there hasn't been any pilling or fading. Really happy with it. :)

There may be some that are more survival oriented or that have a fancier steel Or sheath, but not better value. I got this one for camping food slicing and as a backup to my woodsy knife that literally cost more than 10x more. This has a 6 inch blade. I wanted stainless for food so I wouldn't have to put oil on it. The other reviews say the blade is 1/10 inch. Sounds right. It is a stiff blade with very little bend to it. Great grip with good palm swell and nice rubbery feel. Sheath is their usual plastic but more than adequate for any real life purpose.

 I thought about the model with the 8 inch blade but didn't really need one that long. And I don't see exactly what you would use that for that this one won't do better and that one would be cumbersome for some purposes.

The circular contrast of fibers with the light channeling is what makes it pop. I shoot clays and have a few different brands and this bead would look nice on any of them. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect this thing to be gigantic. It seems compact because of the nested fiber colors, where a solid bead would take up the whole space. The odd thing to me was that the bottom is not completely flat. It has a small raised area near the screw post, maybe to keep it from rubbing off a finish? This will not hold on its own and does need some sort of adherent (loctite, etc.) As you can find on handgun forums, this is a great front sight post replacement for handguns too.

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quickly enough. Because spring coils are not used in this trampoline, it has a quieter action than traditional mini trampolines. It is a very sturdy unit. Absolutely love this thing. The ""petals"" help to widen the jumping surface, and also help warn me (when my foot feels the petal edges) when I am straying too far from the center of the trampoline. My college age daughter now comes to my room every day to exercise on the trampoline as well :).

The watch's description on Amazon states: ""Water resistant to 100m (330ft): in general, suitable for swimming and snorkeling, but not diving."" On the second day of our most recent trip the watch stopped working, apparently due to water that had entered the display. My strong advice is to not purchase this watch if you plan to use it while snorkeling. Doing some additional research, I discovered that to really be considered adequate for snorkeling, a watch should be rated to 200 M /  20 ATM. Watches, like this Timex, rated to 100 M /  10 ATM should be OK for light swimming, but not for snorkeling. Whatever we decide on as a replacement will be rated for 200 M / 20 ATM.

While it certainly works, the design could be tweaked just a bit to greatly improve the usability. I will say that having my phone easily accessible right in front of me while riding is very handy. I was also pleasantly surprised by how well the touch screen works through the plastic.

At some point I will probably make some modifications so the bag fits snugly on the cross-tube. Right now the velcro straps are too long, and the bottom of the bag is flexible, so when you pull the straps tight it causes the bag to bend around that tube. Because the straps don't have the hook portion of the velcro covering the entire length, they barely attach. If there was a rounded rubber support on the backside that rested on top of the tube this would be perfect.

The fit is easy to customize with Velcro holders, which are very sturdy. I rinse the bottles and wash the caps every time I use it and let them air dry completely before storing.  The only downside I have seen is that the bottles can by a little tricky to slide back into the holder with one hand.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have put a good portion of time and thought into reviewing this product. Overall, I have determined it deserves 5 stars. I have taken several photos which show the condition when it arrived.

Pros:
Pretty comfortable, sturdy, back support, insulated container to place beverages into on the arm, many easy to access pouches, comes with carrying case, price, size (fits in trunk yet still large enough to enjoy)

Cons:
Couple of loose strands (see picture), head part supports up to shoulders (does not support with the semicircle part of the back), extremely wrinkled, number of pockets seems to be a bit much

I love this chair and will be using it tons in the future with my camping trips. If you are considering a chair which will support and last a long time, this can be the portable chair for you. If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you. The amount of places to store things tends to be a bit much for the display aspect. Overall, this is a solid chair.",0

I will definately purchase more of these, and will feel comfortable wearing them for tanning, at the beach or at the waterpark, they will look good anywhere.

I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!

I tried this on several occasions and was not able to wear it for longer than 10 minutes before it just became uncomfortable.  It's really just a cloth that will hold wetness longer than say a plain cotton cloth.

If you leave it sit out to dry, it turns stiff.  Just wet it and it becomes soft again.  I wet it and placed it inside the plastic tube it comes in and two weeks later it was still soft and moist.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I did not buy this for hanging deer. I built a 9'x8' shelf in my garage and established it at about 4.5 feet so a car's nose could go under it, but there would still be sufficient room to store meaningful items on top of it (like snow blowers, lawn mowers, generators, etc...). The problem is getting the seasonal equipment onto the shelf. Most of it is pretty darn heavy. I initially looked into some block & tackle systems but was shocked at the prices for what I considered very modest quality. I finally settled on this as a lift system. I was about a third the cost of the cheapest block & tackle and better quality. I use the hangar part that you affix the deer legs to as the lifting hook and bolted the rest to the ceiling just a few inches out from the shelf. Using this system, I can lift by myself a 150 pound snowthrower 4.5 feet into the air and onto the shelf I made for the season once spring arrives.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application.

It may not leak water, but its terrible at keeping a good seal on the air chamber! The two 3L hydration engines I ordered couldn't keep air pressure for more than 30 minutes. I'd pump it up, get a strong stream of water, then a half hour later all the air had leaked out and I'd have to repump it. What a pain!

My solution was to replace the o-ring on the air port side with a slightly thicker one, and lube it with a thin coating of vasoline. I also added a tiny bit of vasoline into the power bulb to lubricate the two ball check valves to help keep a better seal.

Now, no more leaks! I can let it sit overnight and it'll still be pressurized.

Also, one thing I've noticed is that they have two different styles of power bulbs. If your power bulb has an air release button then it will likely never seal properly. You need a power bulb with a screw style air release mechanism in order to get a good air seal.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I have 3 sets of these gloves... two of the prevouos model with the criss cross velcro strips and one of the newer rubber strips.
I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and go across terrain, very few mirrors will remain stationary unless you crank it down.  But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too.",0

I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know it when you see it. If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory. And lastly, the lines are complete junk. Plan to replacement them with 40-100 lb test line or a stronger string. If you don't, you are lucky to get them in and out of the water a few times.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.

The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches.
Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.

Pros:
*Saves a ton of room
*Hardware included that worked well
*Easy to install

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.

I opted for this case instead and was pleasantly surprised to find that I can fit my rifle with scope and a magazine inserted into it's well. As my picture shows, there is room for extra mags also.
One thing that I like is that when it's closed, the soft foam really compresses around the rifle and holds it in place. I have shook the case and swung it around and upon reopening it, everything was still in the the original positions that I had placed them in. You also get nylon straps that you can screw into the case with the provided screws to secure your rifle. Honestly, I don't think that i will put them in because  of the aforementioned reason,  although it certainly wouldn't hurt.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Low-end, Shimano/SRAM hub compatible 9-speed cassette.  It's heavy, and designed for steel hubs.  Works like a champ.  Holds up to high wattage, and standing on a climb in the large gear.

If you have aluminum or titanium hubs, or are concerned about a couple of ounces of weight, then you want a higher-numbered cassette with a large-gear spider.

This is very wide range, pretty evenly stepped from 11T to 34T.  This is great for a compact double crankset (34/50), giving a 1:1 (WHEELIES!) for monster climbs, and a 4.5:1 for powering downhill at 35mph.

Since it's 9-speed, and such a wide range, you may find some of the mid spacing a little too much if you are mostly on even, flat pavement.

If you do only hard, off-road climbs, you may find this is not enough (vs some of the new 42T pizza plates lately).

EDIT 2017 - Subtracting a star because the description now says it has a spider, but it does not.  A spider is a solid block of aluminum serving as the core for the biggest cogwheels.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.  My choice for outdoors is&nbsp;, which is quite tough and very durable, Wilsons NCAA Indoor/Outdoor Tackified Synthetic Leather is also great, but seems to no longer be available.",0

I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,"What a extreme disappointment this kayak is.  I ended getting a hole right in the seam of the haul right underneath where I was sitting. This occurred after my third time taking it out. I was a couple miles down river from my car and was left stranded with a sinking boat beyond repair. The repair kit would not hold at the seam and I had zero chance of making a safe return.

I emailed Sea Eagle about my issue and had sent them a picture of the hole to which they replied the hole would not be covered under the warranty and there was nothing they would do. So basically I'm left with a useless boat and I just threw it away.

Even though this craft maker claims there is a warranty be very careful you don't damage it because you may be stuck with a whole lot of uninflatable rubber like me.

Also, the foot pump busted after the first use and I just bought a hand pump to use. The boat itself would constantly pull and never tread in a staight line.

I thought about upgrading to the tougher 380x, but after further consideration of their warranty, or lack there of, I decided against spending that much on something that may leave me in the same predicament.",0

As I said in my review of the stem, I was so happy when I sat on the bike after the conversion that I cried.

Thank you other reviewers and bloggers...you gave me the courage to order the parts and the ability to finally sit completely upright.  My full review of the products together and process is on the Sunlite stem page...I don't want to bore with repetition.  I will say, the handlebars seem like very good quality to me.  I like the straight front which will accept a basket, and the grip part was long enough for my vintage Schwinn grips plus brake levers.  I have downtube shifters and, as others have noted, there is not enough room on the straight back portion to have grips, shifters, and brakes.  But it worked for me.  I did as another reviewer reported and angled the bars down a little, so my wrists are in their natural, straight alignment when on the grips.  Am loving the whole set up!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"I really looked forward to getting these having read the reviews but so far have found them awkward in the following ways:
1. The fenders tend to warp easily meaning that if they follow the cross-section curvature at the brake end, they will be way off center at the mud flap end.  You can do a limited amount of adjusting but so far I haven't managed to get it quite right
2. Creep - be careful and don't try to get them too close to the tire - no closer than 3/8ths of an inch, otherwise with vibration the forward end of the blade will creep down towards the tire and several times I have caught it between the tire and the brakes.  I would recommend keeping the blade about 3/4 of an inch from the rear brake.
3. I use these only occasionally - in Colorado we don't have much rain, so they are on and off, mainly during the winter - they are easy to install, but I do seem to have to spend a lot of time aligning them properly.  Might be easier for someone who leaves them on for longer periods - I don't know.

I've had them for a couple of months - will stick with them but my enthusiasm has been dented a bit.",0

I am a 32 year old man, so I don't have to worry about wearing them in the woods. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a spare tire, and the strap is a bit loose, but it's great that it is on the pack. The strap does a good job of keeping the pack in place, and I like the quality. I don't have to pull it down with my hands, but I do have to pull it up and keep the top of my head up.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife.

Within 6 months of getting my road bike, the white tape it came with was starting to yellow and deteriorate.

The extra thickness of the DSP tape helps make rough roads more pleasant. Also, the synthetic material remains easy to grip even with damp or sweaty gloves.

The resistance band in between the velcro cuffs gives you resistance whether you're shuffling laterally or taking big steps forward, backward, or diagonally.

It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.
The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.
The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.
Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).
I can get 2 foldable beach chairs hung on the front bar.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",0

This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on.",0

The stove is made of high quality aluminum and the lid is very easy to open and close.

This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him.

Shaves hairs off of your arm out of the box. Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,CG,"Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

- Easy to use

I would recommend this product to anyone.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...

In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!

They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.

I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.

So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good.",0

A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads.

The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have had some bad experiences with cheap carabiners in the past, so when I picked up a pair of these, I was pretty skeptical. However, as I opened these up I immediately noticed the quality construction. The gate is firm, easy to use, and is not sloppy at all. In fact, it feels the same as my Black Diamond Neutrino carabiners. The form of the carabiner looks really solid and in fact at a glance looks like something you'd spend good money on at an outfitter. The Favofits are about a centimeter shorter in length than the Black Diamond, and are noticeably thinner. However, I feel very confident using them for their intended purpose, and that is, of course, hanging my hammock. So perhaps you're sacrificing some load bearing capabilities by not buying a proper climbing biner, but what you lose in load capacity, you gain by this carabiner's ultralight weight. Each comes in at well under an ounce and are among the lightest carabiners in the industry. As a backpacker, I truly appreciate that.

In short, worth it for the weight savings, I don't feel like I'm skimping for my needs, and I'd buy again. In fact, my friend is picking up a pair tomorrow. Excellent.

Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.

I ordered the four on the low end because I was afraid of them being too tight. They are very comfortable and they fit well and are very comfortable.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"These are great patches they wipe well and pretty much fit any caliber.  I use them on my AR.  However... DO NOT pinch too much fabric into the ring as it WILL get stuck in your barrel. This happened to me (twice ) I embarrassingly admit.  First timer I took to a gun smith and he poked it out with a rifle rod.  The 2nd I just stepped on the otis cord and PULLED my heart out.

They say you can use each cloth 6 times but if you have a dirty barrel it's more like 3-4... the inserts get opened up and lose integrity and it makes it easy for the patch to break and again... get stuck (happened as well) but I used a rifle rod to push it out.

I've since become a master of these patches and have used over 65....  meaning I've done about 3 times the swipes or like 200 swipes through my rifles.

I recommend the smaller 2 inch patches as they are less likely to get stuck but these are still great.  I always pinch close to the inserts and never use a flimsy patch. I always give it a nice tug to make sure it won't fall off.  I also always check how big it clumps up at the base.  It should feel like a tiny pebble or whatever.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"First, let me say I can't say with high degree of confidence that this waterproofer works. After all, all my observations are totally subjective. Furthermore, I have applied this waterproofer to mostly Gore-tex garments, which are naturally waterproof because they are made of high-tech synthetic materials.

I bought these specifically because my snowboard garments (jacket, pants, and gloves) are made by Arteryx which specifically recommends this product for waterproofing after few washes. Supposedly, Gore-tex loses some of the waterproof capabilities (never completely) after few machine-washes. This is also the same waterproofer Arteryx uses in the production of its garments.

After the application of this waterproofer, the clothes become slightly more rigid after drying. What I have also noticed is that my Gore-tex garments are still very waterproof (but they were very waterproof to begin with).

I have applied these to my leather shoes and it seems to work fine. I live in Los Angeles and it hardly rains here and I don't wear my leather shoes during the few days it does rain. So I can't confirm that it works well for leather shoes waterproofing.

Pros:
1)It seems to work well. Arteryx recommends this specific product for Gore-tex waterproofing after few washes.
2)Easy application. Just spray it. It doesn't have any toxic smell (doesn't mean it isn't toxic). You need to let it dry for few hours.
3)You can apply these to leather shoes without discoloring or negative cosmetic effects.

Cons:
1)Hard to tell the difference between before and after. Maybe this isn't a bad thing.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I used to be stuck on Kershaw and CRKT for folding knives, but once I started looking for ""larger"" folding knives - I had to turn elsewhere.

Enter Cold Steel. The Voyager is a GREAT heavy duty folder. I'll make this simple and quick - you get all the blade quality and blade size with NONE of the weight and the ridiculously large handles that some companies put out.

The Large Voyager gives you a solid 4"" blade of nicely crafted AUS-8 stainless steel. I used to hate knives with the lock on the back of the handles. Cold Steel has changed that. I now LOVE them, those tri-ad locks are the best! Tougher than old leather, but not impossible to manipulate. I can open and close my Voyager easily with one hand, but I'm not supremely confident when I have the blade locked into position and ready for a tough task. As much as I like my other folders, even the ones with good liner locks....I can't say the same of them for some tasks.

Another note on the handles - they have good texture. It's aggressive, but not bitingly so. Are they thin? Yes, but they're tough. They're also comfortable, having the right grooves in the right places, allowing you good purchase on the knife, regardless of your hand size, I'm thinking.

The Voyager, in whatever configuration you prefer, is the best large folding knife I've ever come across, and the price is quite reasonable. Buy one, you'll like it!",0

The bat is a good value, and it's going to last a long time. I haven't used it with a single bat, but I'll try it with a single bat once. I just can't imagine using it with a single bat, because it will feel very weak.

I've also purchased a few others. I've only used one bat, but I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a good value, and I can't imagine spending a lot more money on one.

The bat has a nice handle, and the handle is very comfortable. I've used it with a stick, and it doesn't seem to be that bad.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.

I don't really use a remote line for my marker since I'm worried about my mobility of running in pretty thick woods with a wire hanging down but I thought that's a good thing to have just in case if I decide to do so in the future.

I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping.

These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full.

First impressions it's not exactly portable long distances. It's cool because it fits in a closet in my apartment and easily in my truck bed but most people would struggle carrying the large heavy bag long distances. I suggest making very sure you have it fully inflated as all rigidity is lost otherwise. With this fully inflated I do still experience a bending where I am sitting but it comes with an inflatable pillow thing to jam in the corner...put it in the back corner and you'll be fine. It also seems quite durable. Similar material to whitewater rafts. I got caught in a rapidly leaving tide out in the mangroves and hit quite a few sharp sticks and things and didn't sink.

It actually tracks surprisingly well because of the added length and rudder thing you can put on the bottom. Tracks better than most cheaper end molded kayaks for sure.

The perks of having it oversized are immense. Plenty of leg room (for once) room for a cooler and all my fishing gear without being cramped. I always throw the air pump in the netting compartment also just to be safe.

The color is a little too pink.  The band is very thin and doesn't stretch very well.  The bands are very thin and it's difficult to wear them on my hands.  They will probably stay put for a while.  I'm not sure how long they will last, but they are definitely worth the money.

My thoughts:

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"This is a robust, well-made chain cleaning device of debatable utility.

Here's how it works. You fill it with soapy water or degreaser. Then you attach it to your chain and attempt to backpedal. The gears complain and water sloshes out from both sides because it has much more friction than you expected. You eventually find a hand position that keeps it stable and doesn't repeatedly derail the chain, then doggedly run it through.

The result is a clean-looking chain. The outside part. The inside part that actually matters is mostly untouched. This, after probably two minutes of running the chain in both directions.

Here's what actually worked: a bunch of cheap microfiber cloth towels (they don't disintegrate like cheap cotton towels), WD-40 bike degreaser, and Finish Line's ""Gear Floss."" Put WD-40 (or practically any other degreaser) on the microfiber, hold the chain through it, and run it through until it's clean on the outside. Then, for each big link, double up a piece of gear floss and pull it through. Do the small links too if you want. Total time is about three minutes. It's cleaner, faster, cheaper, and more thorough than this thing.

If you really want the chain to sparkle, spend a moment to undo the quick-link (probably) holding it together. Then put it in a soda bottle with ten or twelve ounces of citrus degreaser and shake for a minute or two. Short of an ultrasonic cleaning or soaking the chain in petroleum solvents and scrubbing it with a brush, that's as clean as it's going to get.",0

I had a friend who was going to have a bat in a local store that had a similar bat and we were using it for batting practice. This bat was great and we loved it. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it and it fit our needs.

We just went to Walmart and bought a new bat. It was $30 cheaper than the old bat and we were thrilled with the price. The bat was a little heavy so we put it in a bag with it and put it in a closet where it would be kept. We were able to put it in the cooler and we couldn't get it into the cooler. It was a good fit and we were able to bat practice with it.

The feel of this knife is so sturdy, I love the weight distribution and the solid, yet silky smooth action of the blade on its hinge. I can flip this knife open easily with a flick of my wrist due to its weight.

The steel is very interesting. I love the two types of steel fused together with copper...one stronger and harder to provide the a good base to attach the softer, more easily sharpened edge piece...I don't know how operationally effective it will turn out to be in the long run but the concept is great and so far I've had no problems.

WARNING: IF LEFT WITH MOISTURE THIS BLADE WILL RUST. DUE TO THE MATERIALS USED THE BLADE WILL DEVELOP RUST IF LEFT UN-OILED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN DAMP AREAS. IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE QUALITY BE SURE TO STORE THE KNIFE WITH A LIGHT SHEEN OF OIL ON IT.

The above is mentioned in the knife manual that comes in the package but it is not mentioned in the product details, which it probably should be. Luckily I read the directions when they're provided so I will be able to prevent rust on this beautiful knife.

This is no lightweight bike. I was actually pretty stunned to receive the box and there was considerable weight to it. The instructions were decent and it took about 20 minutes to put together. The only thing is that the pedals and straps are plastic, so I wonder how long they will hold up.

This is a very quiet bike. I can easily be riding this while watching TV and I never need to increase the volume. Its literally that quiet.

The little display is decent and does a fairly good job. Just know that you will need to hold the button down to reset your last ride information.

There is quite the large seat on this, but with the pedals where they are, you won't use much of it unless you have super long legs. Im 511 and I can only use the front half of the seat. Its fairly comfortable and Im thankful for that.

If there is one *ding* to this bike is the seat location compared to the pedals. My butt is roughly at 50 degrees to the metals, which isn't a normal feeling. Its abojt midway between a normal bike and a recumbent bike. I do wish the pedals were more beneath me like a normal bike, but for a space saver bike at this price, I cant really complain too much.

It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski gloves (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hands up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mittens (the thick kind with waterproof covers).",0

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I practice and teach olympic lifting, and I put these through the paces yesterday doing snatches and handstands - two movements where my wrists feel weakest. Out of the package, these felt really high quality, and they didn't disappoint during the actual use either. They provide a good amount of support without limiting natural movement. The construction is excellent and the material feels sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seams are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wraps are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wraps that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This was plenty of support for me on handstands and snatches both, and the wraps didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps.

Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessories after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stays clean and smelling nice.

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us.

So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.

Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason.

Size right out of package
Each towel spread out
Large metal bowl
2 cups of water
1 towel absorbed most of it
2nd towel absorbed the rest of the 2 cups of water
Left no water in the bowl!
One thing I did notice is that when I wrung the towels out was that the water was blue tinted, so you may want to wash before using on your skin.

It was too big for him and he is too small.  He does not like the fact that it is too small, but he does not like the fact that it is too large.  It is too big and it is too small.

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"Let me start by saying that this is an awesome knife for the money.  I have one in my family and the other in my office.  The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.

One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists. ",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"I've been using this on and off for a few months, and suddenly the spring button just snapped off, and now it's useless. While it was working, the plastic bottle is durable and can withstand drops. I don't like the circular ring because it kind of digs/cuts into your fingers if you hold it by there. Another difficulty is that the infuser part - has 2 parts - a plastic circular lid with holes and then the infuser where you put the fruit in. the plastic lid just sits on top of it, and then the two pieces are screwed in. Thus, it is easy to lose the little plastic circular part when you take it apart for cleaning. They do give you two - the purple smaller one and the longer clear infuser, which I personally use(d) the most because it could hold more fruit. Also, the shorter infuser required you to have the bottle full or shaken or sideways to keep the fruit submerged in the water if you drank even just half! There is a locking system for the lid - but it became quite loose after time. Remember, I only used this not that many times. Finally, the worst part was screwing the lid onto the bottle - it is easy to screw it on improperly - and thus instantly leaks - so you have to be very careful each time to make sure you screw it on perfectly horizontal, and that's not something I need in the morning if I'm in a rush to workout or just go to work! I would not recommend buying this bottle.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I went with the 30 minn kota for my 14 ft flat bottom, trying to save a little money. The small motor does decent.... your not going anywhere in a hurry, lol. Also, if it is pretty windy, you are going to struggle, I took this motor to land between the lakes, and tried to use it to move around the main banks on a very windy ""white cap day""...... it worked okay. if your trying to move towards the direction the wind is coming from, you may have some issues. I have used this little motor on 3 different boats, my 14 ft flat bottom, a 12 ft flat bottom we rented (10HP max lake), and a 10 ft v bottom. It works about the same on all 3, the small 10 footer is a heavy boat, maybe even heavier than my 14 ft.

Bottom line, it will do the job. It will move you around coves, or even across small, not so windy channels. BUT.... if you can afford to spend another 65 bucks, just buy the 40 LBS, I can promise you, you will be happier with it. Not saying Im not happy with this small motor, but I do wish I had the extra 10 ft LBS for windy days, or rivers with a swifter current. If you cant afford the other one, or refuse to wait any longer and saye up (like I did.... lol, couldn't wait), buy this one. Like I said, small boats, calm lake, you will get around pretty good. On a river, stronger current, or a windy day.... not so much. Hope this helps someone.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bough this when I was living out in Missouri for a year. The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"I ordered this pack, approximately, 2.5lbs, which is about as big as I could carry. I had to adjust the straps, but it is okay. This pack is very large and it is well made. It is a perfect size for my size 7.5-8.5 hips. It is very comfortable to wear, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do.

The pack is very sturdy, and the handle is very well built. It has a nice, high quality strap that is very easy to attach and remove. The sleeve is very comfortable and I like that it does not have any pockets for my phone, which is a plus.

I am also very happy with the sizing of the pack, as I am very confident that this will be a very good fit for me. I am a tall woman, and I am normally 5'6"", about 200 lbs.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless.",0

The plastic parts are solid and the plastic part looks great. The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This yoga mat by Heart Centered Yoga LLC is great for my 21 Day Fix program that I'm doing.  It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Took it shooting yesterday. Only took 6 rds to get it dialed in at 50 yards right out of the box!! The clarity outside in actual use was far better than what I thought while looking through it inside my house at night, from 3x all through 12x. The side parallax adjustment is great as well. I was able to ring steel at 200 with boring regularity, and it didn't seem to lose zero after 100 rounds of .308. Only complaint is that there is a little bit of distortion and the edges of the filed of view, but it's only noticeable if you intentionally look at the edges.

The illuminated reticle uses a light that washes all over the inside of the scope, not just on the crosshairs, so that is a bit of an annoyance, but I don't forsee myself using the illuminated reticle. Just putting that out for those that will.

The rings that come with the scope appear to be of phenomenal quality, every bit as good as the Warne rings I purchased for another rifle. There are 4 screws per ring that tighten around the tube, which I feel provides a far more secure mount.

I wish the rings positioned it a hair higher, but overall I am extremely pleased with the performance of the scope. Even more so considering for my $113 delivered to my door, I got a set of rings that seem every bit as good as the last 30mm rings I got from Warne for another AR.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"For background, by trade I'm a professional mechanic, so I'm able to follow directions fairly easily.  This had myself and my father scratching our heads quite a bit.  The directions clearly tell you to put the ""height adjustment"" sticker on the WRONG side of the pole.  Also, installing the ""adjustment shock"" is fairly complicated and we ended up with the orange 'boot' upside down, despite several minutes of brain storming trying to interpret the directions.  They are written with a picture illustrating the overall goal of that particular step, with one line (presumably the most important note) describing what should have happened once you completed the step.  For example, instead of saying ""Install bolt (A) through pole and backboard, then use washer (B) and nut (C)"" the direction will have a picture of how those parts go together (you figure out where the picture is talking about) with note saying ""Ensure (C) goes on left side.""  Seriously.

Secondly, don't be fooled, this is a PLASTIC backboard, despite how the picture looks and how the description cleverly talks about it being shatter proof.  It is NOT glass, and it WILL respond as a plastic backboard does when a ball hits it.  Also, I've had it installed for just over 1 month now, and the rim is already starting to squeak/creak when a basket is made.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin cans and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and as a contractor, I have nail guns that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellets will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellets are are also among my favorites. My only accessories were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivels myself, but that was an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that was it. The rifle is very accurate with its iron sights (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellets through the same hole after about 15 rounds...

Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and its a proven design that has been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just wants a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 stars for its design and reliability!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Interesting concept. I've seen a couple of mentions of the bumps and their purpose. I'm told they're to stimulate circulation. I don't know. They're not terribly comfortable and I would not want to sit on this thing with thin pants, or in pajamas or boxers, I do know that. If it were summer I would try throwing a towel across it to cushion the bumps and to keep my bare skin off the plastic.

It does work to keep your posture correct. I use it at my desk and I find it much more difficult to slouch. My biggest problem is that it is so narrow. I am about 6'4"" and 225 pounds. I'm not fat by any means. But my backside is too wide for this thing. My 11-year-old son could perhaps fit on it comfortably, but if you're an adult you might be in trouble.

I think it's a good idea, but just too small to be really effective (or comfortable). It's good that it comes with an inflating needle because I no longer have those around the house, my days of football and basketball being well behind me. It would be nice if it came with a pump but those are easy to obtain so I won't quibble over that.

I'd recommend it, despite the comfort issues, simply because it is better than the alternative. There are a lot of things we could and should do as we sit all day at our computers and ergonomics are critical. Get your monitor at eye level, your keyboard to where your arms and hands don't strain, and sit up straight! This, at least, will help with the latter until something better comes along.",0

The only downside is that the grip seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The grip is made of a material that is not stiff enough to allow it to hold a lot of weight. The grip is a bit too small to be comfortable, but the grip is not stiff enough to be comfortable. I would not recommend this grip to anyone who is considering purchasing this grip.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"If I'd followed the fit guide they would have been a mess. Good thing I've lived with my petite self for so long I knew the larger size wouldn't work for me because I've got short hands. The smaller size is a bit snug, but not too tight. The length of palm from bottom of fingers to wrist is too long for me. They will be too long for any true petite leading to extra bunching in palm and thumb crease area. If you've got ""normal"" length fingers/hands they'll probably be fine.

The seam on the palm between the forefinger and thumb is fine on the left hand, but stiff, sharp and uncomfortable on the right hand. The padding doesn't seem like much, and there is still discomfort while riding, but post ride there is significantly less lingering discomfort than wearing none. The padding is in a great place to protect the meaty part of the lower palm. It seemed the middle of the palm didn't have much.

There are two very large tags in one glove, but I make sure they are folded up to the upper part of the hand vs. the palm and they haven't bothered me. The grey color is nice and the white parts help for hand signal visibility.  They were the best out of the 10 I tried on in a store, but there's room for improvement.

Still surprised that companies don't make goods in petite and tall versions of things. All the rest of the clothing fashion community can manage it, why not cycling?

Overall they're pretty good. If they were destroyed I'd get a pair again until I figure out that magical illusive well-fitting, perfectly padded pair.",0

I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch.",0

I don't think I'll be able to use it for much longer than a day of riding.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact bike that won't require much to do.

The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Good Quality bag, should hold up well. Like the looks of it. Tapered front fits under seat well. Strap on rear for tail light is nice.
I don't care for some bags out there that have all kinds of outside straps, bottle holders, pockets, etc. This one is more streamlined with your stuff stored inside the bag, not held somehow on the outside. And the inside is roomy!

Held back on a 5 star rating for several reasons.

One, it's a little pricey. Forty bucks is a lot for a bag to store stuff on the back of your bike.

And secondly the design of how the top opens up could be better.
The top is held closed by two zippers down each side, plus a velcro closure across the front.
The velcro flap is located under your seat, where it is hard to get to. And it's strong velcro, so you really need to get a firm grip on it.
And then the zippers are held together with a strap, the idea being that you can pull on the strap and open both zippers at the same time.
In theory this sounds good but reaching the strap, which is also under the seat, is not the easiest thing to do either.

I ended up cutting off the strap holding the 2 zippers together. This helps quite a bit. Now I can quickly open the bag just on one side without having to undo the velcro. And you can pretty much grab what you want with just one zipper open.

IF the zippers opened from the rear, and the velcro closure was across the rear, then it would be an ideal bag and maybe I wouldn't feel like forty bucks was too much for it.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This performed wonderfully in my first triathlon this past May, Olympic distance. I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.

The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.

While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding. Perhaps it is my seat that I could add cushion to instead, and most likely get a better fitting, (too many variables to detract a star in my book), I found the padding to be thin but adequate for the 25 miles I was on the bike.",0

The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it.",0

I bought this board in June 09. I was so busy in Summer that I didn't touch it until January '10. I hit the wall with my run and Nordic Track Ski Machine no longer 'shock' my body. Having stuck in the house during winter months doesn't do good to the body either. Hence, I was gaining a bit of weight. I put this board behind my couch facing the TV and ever since then - I was hooked. It took me about 4-5 days to start getting a hang of it(I never skate board or roller blade before). I held on to the back of the couch during those 4-5 days to prevent any falls from happening. Effect

After 2 weeks, I am close to going back to my weight in Summer. My waist is trimmed again; I wake up to sore gluts and core muscles - the best feeling ever! I am now a believer in this equipment and will use it a lot more throughout the year. Activities

It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin.

Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.

Functionally it is not bad.
It does have a very clear view if it is plastic, better than many.
I'd rated higher but - 1 the handle bar mounting bracket is a rigid plastic - typically these don't last very long exposed to the sun. They get brittle and break easily. 2 - there is no way to lock the mirror in position so bumps (or branches) cause the mirror to move. The main arm can be tightened into position with the main mounting screw which helps. The arm is a thicker rigid plastic and should hold up pretty well to street usage.
Will have to be careful with this off road or if you tend to lay (kids drop) your bike as it will break. My arm actually twisted when it fell over, it did not break.
The mounting bracket will only fit on the thinner portion of the handle bar - look closely at the listing photos to see what I am referring to.
If you don't have this area available it won't fit. I was going to mount it on my handlebar bar ends but it is to small for them. It will only fit right next to the shifter which had to be adjusted a little to let it fit on the bar around the shifter and its cable.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"As my former bugout bag (45L, no frame S&W tactical pack, which I truly love) hath recently runneth over, I was in the market for a larger, molle compatible pack with an internal frame. When I was offered this pack at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, I jumped at it.

This is my third bag from Gonex, but the first one that doesn't fold up into its  own pocket. I was impressed with the heavy duty 900D nylon and the quality construction throughout. The shoulders, waist belt and back are nicely padded. The molle attachments on top, back and sides allow the bag to be configured in various ways by adding molle compatible pouches, and there are straps on top and bottom for carryig sleeping bags, tents etc.

My favorite features:
- included, attached rain cover (this is in the semi hidden very bottom pocket, zipper next to the lumbar padding). I also like that the rain cover on the desert camo pack is a solid tan. When deployed, the pack looks more 'weekend getaway' and less 'SHTF' with the solid cover.
- pockets in the waist belt. They aren't huge, but will fit small items like a wallet, phone or power bars.
- the zipper runs the full length of the main compartment, giving easy access to everything
- there are 5 pockets on the inside of the main compartment flap; 1 zippered, 2 velcro and 1 open mesh
- 3 position height adjustment
- water bottle/ snack pockets on the sides
- molle attachments everywhere!

My minor quibble:
- the lining and cover are a slightly different color (more yellow) than the tan in the camo. Not a huge deal, but I would have liked it to match.

Overall, this is an excellent pack that is worth the price.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"My experience with the Kestrel 4500NV with ATRAG (and Bluetooth):

1) No indication that Kestral can be updated via flashing the firmware; if there is an ATRAG issue, you could be out of luck

2) The ""Gun Library"" software has recently become available on Horus' website (after missing for most of the year). However, the software does not appear to install correctly. (We've tested it on Windows 7 (64bit) and Windows XP (w/SP3)). The software is supposed to be able to look up factory ammunition loads from a MS Access database that installs with the software.  What you get instead is a ""DSN Driver"" error. So it doesn't appear to work properly.

3) You can finally download the settings, and you can upload them. However, you can not remove all of the guns in the Kestrel. Which is cheesy is you are trying to use the Gun Library to sync them.

4) Customer support on the Horus side seems to include many reports from people with much more time in grade, per se, than myself, of ignoring their customer base.

5) Kestrel, with generally makes great products, has an online support forum system that requires INDIVIDUAL approval of posts made. So, even when you mention something not really negative but without a positive spin on their product, the post doesnt get approved (that's not a good sign)

6) Kestrel has finally upgraded the software on their site to version 1.7, which seems to now work with Windows 7; this was previously not the case.

For a product this expensive, you'd think the software from Horus Vision would actually work properly. It doesn't.

Does the device itself work? It appears to. Has its support software been well vetted, no.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading.",0

I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.

On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.

Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing.....",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion.",0

I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure.",0

I do not plan on using it in river waters, lakes, etc. since the filters are $89-$99 a pop, unless I have to.  The filters are ten dollars cheaper at Infowars. I will use it in a camping situation. If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my wife. She hates learning new electronics and is quite picky about things like this. She loves it! First unlike the fitbit which is listed as Water Resistant to 10M (But Fitbit SPECIFICALLY advises not to Swim or Shower with it) this device is approved by Polar for swimming and showering. The touch sensor scrolls through the different info easily (it also pairs to the app or H7 Heart rate monitor with one touch). She LOVES the simplicity! It seems to be very accurate and GOOD LORD this thing charges at TURBO SPEED! I will go as far to say that I have never owned ANY device that charges as fast as this, it is UNREAL. Yes you have to cut the thing to size initially but I like that feature. They send a foolproof measuring tape (it does not have mm, cm or inches it just tells you how much notches to count down and clip). I found that even with that tape it is conservative by one notch just to be safe. Once you trim it you instal a double action stainless clasp (very similar to the one on a $500.00 watch) which engages securely and feels quality made. I put it on before sizing it and it looks just at home on my wrist or my wifes. Subtle chrome accents set the face off adn compliment the clasp. My wife is very petite and it sized down to her well and she says it is quite comfortable. The display is very bright when on and easy to read (it is off by default but barely brushing the touch sensor with a finger shows the time or cycles through the modes immediately. So far my wife and I have been very impressed with it and she does not miss her favorite watch it replaced.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.",0

The only negative is that the mesh flap is a little short for the rubber hose.  I have to leave it in the car and it goes out of the way.  I would buy again.I used this to hold my rifle and a shotgun in a bag on the patio of my house. The netting was very nice and easy to install. I was able to keep it and put it in my closet without it getting in the way. It is a very good product for the price. I would recommend it for any hunting situation.I like the color and quality. I wish they had the color logo on the back of the bag. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a great quality bag. I have been using this bag for a few months now and I am very pleased with how it holds up. I would recommend this bag for anyone looking for a bag that will hold up to a lot of use.I like this little item.  I just bought a small plastic cap, and it fits perfect.  I love that the handle is adjustable.  It looks great and is very comfortable.  It is very lightweight, and I would definitely buy another one.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,"Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"I have a selection of this set and they are just what I needed for my needs. The other two have the same design, but they have different materials, so you should get the right one. It will cost you a bit more for the materials, but you should have the right one. I have the most expensive set and have ordered a second set so far. I just can't get enough of these. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can use it as a pad if you need to put a lot of weight on it. I like that it is a little thicker than my other pants. I like that it is easier to store your belt. It is more comfortable than I thought it would be. I don't have to worry about the buckle getting stuck. I like that it does not get stuck while I'm walking. I like that it does not have a strap that can be removed. The other pants I have have had trouble with it getting stuck. I have had problems with it getting stuck in the bag while I was walking. I can't say much about that because I haven't had any problems with it getting stuck. I would recommend it for those that have problems. I had this one on my bike for about 2 months. I received a replacement and it was perfect. Very comfortable. I haven't tried it yet, but I am impressed with it. It's very comfortable to wear, very comfortable.",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,I'm big into fitness. I've had the HRX for two years now and have worn it every day since. I had a friend who was a weight lifter who had a very large frame and was a little skinny. She said it was a little too big for her. She wore it every day. She's a cardio player and she had to work on it a lot. She said it was great. She felt like a guy and she didn't like that. She said she liked it. I wore it all the time. I felt like a guy.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,CG,"Had my first overnight backpacking trip to the Rocky Mountains in January of this year, I was pretty nervous.  I had a lot of stuff to get through and was nervous about how it would go.  It was in the middle of the night.  I had some water in the tent and a tent bag with a fire starter and some food.  It was a little rough but I didn't have to worry about it getting destroyed by the night.  It was very dry.  I thought I would be fine with it but I felt like I had gotten a ""bad"" tent bag.  I put it in the back of my truck and put my pack in the back of my truck.  I was a bit nervous but I am glad I didn't.  I will be putting this tent back in the truck for a couple weeks and hopefully I will be able to figure out a way to keep the tent from getting destroyed by the night.  I will probably buy a tent from Amazon next time and get some of the other stuff I need to go back to the camp site.  I was very excited to get this tent and was very happy with the purchase.  It was very comfortable.  I was able to put my stuff in the tent and make it stay in the tent.  I had some small stuff that I wanted to keep in the tent but I was able to put my water bottle in the tent.  I am a big fan of Amazon and they have a lot of stuff.  This was a very easy tent to put together. ",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and as described, so that's good.

The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip.

Pros:
They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"This yoga mat is one of the best ever made. I will be purchasing more!Very nice.I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan.

I do recommend it to anyone.This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as I was expecting it to be, but it is thin enough for me to wear in the holster. It is very well made and feels great. I have used this holster on a few occasions and it has held up well. The only complaint I have is that the holster is a little big. I have a large waist and this fit me perfectly. I would not recommend this holster to anyone. I would have to order a smaller one. I am not a big fan of the old style and the old style is not really what I was looking for.These are my favorite shorts! They are comfortable, comfortable, and very comfortable.  I love the material and feel of these shorts.  I have tried a lot of different brands, but I have never been disappointed. I ordered the one that comes",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I almost gave up on these because I just could not get them on - then I did some reading and found there was a trick to it: Turn the sock inside out almost all of the way so that you can just put your toe in. Put your toes in, align it properly so that your heel will line up with the heel of the sock, and then basically roll it onto your foot bit by bit. I'm a Women's 11 and ordered the large; I thought it was too small for me until I tried this. Turns out they fit well.

These are very well-made, high-quality, strong compression socks; in fact, they're probably the first true compression socks I've used given that I never had to do much to get others on. They are quite comfortable once adjusted right. They are very strictly contoured, so if they aren't sitting just right, they feel off. The grey band over the top of the foot near the ankle seems to want to come to rest right where I flex my ankle, which is very uncomfortable. I find I have to pull this part down towards the toe until it rests on top of my foot rather than in front of my ankle. So if you get these, and you're not used to real compression socks, be prepared to fiddle with them a bit.

They're great for exercise and really do reduce soreness.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"These glasses are great for keeping me away from the sun.  I also like the fact that they do not have the lens hood, which is nice, but not a great feature.

The only thing I would say is that it is a little thicker than my other softball bags, but I like that it does not leak. I can not say for sure if it is a defect or a feature, but I have used it for the last month and a half and it still works great!

I recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a softball bag. It is a very solid bag that can be used in any way you like. I have tried it with a ball, baseball, or softball bag, and the ball fits perfectly and I can't say enough about the quality.

I have tried several brands and sizes and these are the best!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"This is a perfect first time purchase and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.

He bought this for his wife and we all loved it.  She loves it!Great product.  Great price and very good product.  I will buy another one from Amazon.  I think I will order another one from Amazon soon.This is a great knife, a great knife for a great price.  I have tried a lot of knives from various brands, but this one is my favorite.  I have been using it for almost a year",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon).",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1,OR,"I should have trusted the poor reviews that I read here.  Many reviews mention that this thing just stops working after a few weeks.  Well, add me to the list - this was fantastic for about 100 shots.  Really great concept.  Sure enough picked it up on day #27, fired 4 shots, then  no-worky -  it stopped lighting up altogether.  When I opened it up, could press the battery down and make it light - but will not light when the cap is on no matter how hard I press the little rubber stopper.

Changed batteries - no go.  Tried putting in a paper insulator as shown by one customer here - DON'T DO THAT!!!! with one layer of paper inside, you cannot remove the batteries again - no way to get them out.

Thank goodness for Amazon returns - this thing is going back right now....  I'll have to try Surestrike or other competing product instead.  But buyer beware - I have not seen a product yet with REALLY good reviews.  Seems like they must all be using cheap $6 Chinese laser pointers and charging $90 as a ""laser cartridge"".  Shame on you, Laserlyte - for the $90 I paid, I deserved more than 100 shots.  Won't buy from them again.

Maybe duct taping my $6 laser pointer to my barrel, and just watching it for movement during my trigger pull will be adequate enough? I'll give it a try.

The stitching is very well made, the stitching is pretty straight, and it's not overly stiff.  The size is perfect and I like the shape of the straps.  I have a large chest and I can wear the ankle strap without any issues.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a compression type thing that can be worn comfortably.

The socks are very soft and breathable.  The material is very comfortable and very durable.  They are a great gift for my daughter and I.This is a very nice gift.  I was looking for something to wear around the house and I was very impressed.  The whole family loves it and will be buying more of it.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I searched all the blogs but NO ONE could tell me how to hang this type of derailleur on a cheap bike...

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is.. BUY the right hanger..Go to the URL and get the hanger and this derailleur will serve you well...I hope this gives the little guys some help..Cheap bikes can become better bikes when you add the right parts..My 32 year old Flying ""O"" O'Tasco bike is lovely, shifts great, rides good....

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"These are fantastic! They fit perfect on my Glock 17. I also love that they have a full sized inner barrel.  The front sight is also very light and easy to adjust.  The only thing I would change is the size of the scope.  This is a great optic for the money.  I have a 11"" scope on the Springfield XD scope with a telescopic sight.  I would buy these again.  I am very happy with these sights.I love these socks! They are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them everyday for cycling, camping, hiking, and hiking. I am a big fan of these socks. I wear them daily to keep warm, and I like that they keep me from sweating. They also keep my feet warm and dry. I do recommend these socks to anyone. My only complaint is that I have a large head. I am 6'2"" and the size 6 fit my head. I would recommend these socks for anyone.I love this bike seat. It's small and easy to use. I have it mounted on my front end, and it's very comfortable to ride. The seat itself is a bit on the stiff side, but it's not a problem. It's also easy to install and adjust. The seat is a little big for me, but it's a lot of room for storage. I ride a Honda Civic with a seatpost for my bike, and it's a little too large for my bike.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!  I received this nonslip towel set at a discount in exchange for my completely unbiased and honest opinion of it.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,CG,"I have say I was a little disappointed with the quality of the product, but I am pretty confident that it will last a long time.  The ring itself is pretty sturdy, and the color is pretty striking.  The size is a little small for me, but it's not a problem.  I have a large chest, which is a little on the small side, but it fits my heart better than I would like.  The color scheme is a little more subdued, but it is still pretty good.  The sleeve is really nice, and it fits great.  The material is pretty nice, and the material is pretty soft.  The only thing I did not like is the color.  I really don't like the color, and I don't think it will be a big deal for me.  I really don't like the design of the company, and I think it is a little weird that I didn't get this.  I will probably buy a different color, but I don't really care about it.  I really don't care that much about the color, so I guess I will just buy the colors.This is the only one I have that will fit my Glock 22 perfectly.  The only negative is that it's a little too large.  If you're going to carry this, you'll need to get a larger size.  It's a little bulky for my Glock 22.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well. An old dress shirt can be cut up to make a lifetime supply of cleaning patches - don't waste money on fancy ones.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"Overall this is a great starter kit and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one. The bottom line is, it's a great starter kit and I think it will last a long time. I have a few other kit on my bike and a few other bikes that have been very good, but this is by far the best I have found. I have a spare tire, and a spare tire that fits on my bike. I have to get the bike mounted on the bike and to make sure the bike is not sitting on the side of the bike. My bike is sitting on the side of the bike with the tire on. If the bike is sitting on the side of the bike, I can't mount it on the bike. This is a very serious problem for me, but I'm glad I didn't have to buy this one. I was very excited to receive this bike and was very happy with the purchase. It's very comfortable to ride, and I'm very happy with the quality of the bike and the quality of the materials.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"My boys (ages 10 and 13) love the swimming pool.  We also have a large pool.  The pool is open to the outside and is easy to clean.  The pool is comfortable and well ventilated.  We have used it for swimming and swimming pool play.  It is a great place to have the pool and hang out.  It is a great pool for adults and children.  The pool is nice and spacious.  I like that the pool is easy to clean.  I do wish the pool had a little extra room for our small children to sit on and play.  They like that it is easy to clean and not have to clean up the pool.

I'm 5'11"" and 140lbs and the pool is a good size for me.  I don't have to worry about the pool getting dirty.  The pool is pretty small, but not too big.  I will probably get a little more room in the pool.  The pool is very good quality, but not very large.  I would definitely buy this again.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought this for my fianc, because we live in a bad area.

Pros:
-Much more natural to use/hold than a common can of pepper spray.
-Well built, feels solid.  It has a thick screw in piece in the back (like a flashlight) where you can remove the propellant.
-Detachable keychain is perfect.  It takes a good bit of force to detach, which is good.

Cons:
-Very short range.  We bought a practice spray canister to try it out, and the spray only has an effective range of about 5 feet.  At the end of this 5 feet it has turned into a cloud of mist, so any breeze will reduce the range even further or cause self harm by blowing it back in your face.  But it is still effective as a last resort close range spray.
-Button is easy to press.  Moving it forward and down does not take as much force as I expected, so it seems there is a risk of it going off accidentally in a purse or pocket, especially since the button is raised and can catch onto things.  This has not happened yet though.
-Extremely limited capacity.  the spray canister is TINY.  You only get a few short sprays out of this, or about a 3 second long spray.  This could be a pro for some, as its less likely a bad guy can use it against you once you unload it.
-As mentioned by others it looks inappropriate from the top.  Someone made some bad design choices on its appearance.

While there may appear to be more cons than pros, this serves its purpose as an easy to use, last resort, close range pepper spray.  It feels very natural and is easy to aim/conceal.  Its always ready if its on your keychain and can be detached if your keys are in the ignition.
I would recommend getting a practice canister to get used to how the button works and the aiming/effective range.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have several stashes (office, home, car, storage locker) of emergency rations and several 'bug-out' bags as I cannot be certain where I'll be if and when the poop hits the propeller. I have had to re-order this item on several occasions to replenish my office stash as I keep snacking on the darn things. Several Points:
1) The 'brick' is aluminized plastic vacuum wrapped around 18 individually wrapped bars. 2) The brick is heavier than you would expect as the moisture content is very low to allow a tightly packed food source in minimal space. 3) Due to the low moisture content you will want a liquid to drink although the bars themselves DO NOT enhance thirst. 4) Once the outer wrapper has been breached, the 5 year shelf life is no longer applicable. The individual bars are wrapped in ultra thin cellophane. 5) The 18 separate bars TOTAL 3600 calories. The Three day calculation is bases on 1,200 calories per day (3 meals a day for 3 days at 2 bars per meal). 6) For those of you who rightly observe that 1,200 calories per day is below the prescribed minimum. keep in mind these bars are coast guard approved emergency rations. They are MISSION SPECIFIC. I. E. : They were designed for the relatively low caloric consumption of sitting, inactive, in a life boat while awaiting rescue. That fact, however, does not diminsh the wisdom of having a supply on hand for emergencies and/or bug-out ration suppliments. One Complaint: as I mentioned before, they use a thin cellophane wrap on each bar (no doubt to further minimize bulk of packaging). The problem is that it is a B*TCH to unwrap. If you do it wrong, the bar will crumble. My technique is to sliide the side of a pocket knife around the flat side of the bar (Much like you were honing the knife on a whet stone) until the edge of the knife catches the edge of the wrapper and then gently work the wrapper off.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"It assembles and breaks down into a single unit, which is a handy feature for the person who needs a pair of sunglasses. The goggles are also designed to be worn in a closed position so that they can be easily moved around without damaging the lenses.

The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I guess I am an old mossback and remember having a basket for my bike but it sure is hard to find one these days for bikes with no fenders and all manner of handlebar styles. Just to be clear, I do use my bike for exercise but not in any way competitively. I use my bike to walk my large dogs on pavement, grass and dirt. It would take forever to wear them out walking and I am too old and arthritic to even consider jogging or running any more. Anyway I could carry gear in a back pack and I have but it is hassle to have to take it off and get stuff out, especially when there is nothing to set it on like a basket and the back pack was getting heavier and heavier and then I found this basket. I cannot imagine any bike this would not fit other than maybe an all out racing bike. Installation is a snap and should not take literally over a minute, you will need no tools and it comes off just as easily if needed. Some of the good features (1) the hooks that go over the handlebars are padded and provide all the support needed (2) the lower support goes on the stem with Velcro (3) the basket itself can be removed from the bracket and carried like a small grocery store basket (4) the bottom of the basket has a small mesh to prevent small items from slipping through. I cannot think of any negatives at all.

Found a big negative. The velcro strap will eventually break and the basket bracket becomes unstable and you can't buy a new strap or just the bracket! I admit to being hard on both the bike and the basket but this has been a real weak link in what is otherwise pretty bullet proof. The next On I think I will see if there is a way I can clamp or wire it on.",0

I am very pleased.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great deal.We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a basement. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the ground. It is a good hammock for the price! You can also put it in the back of a truck. It is very sturdy. It has a nice handle that makes it very comfortable. It is also a very light weight. We used it in our hammock, but it was a little difficult to get it to get into the ground.

We did not expect to be able to set it up with the hammock on it. However, the hammock is very light and easy to set up. We have not had a problem with the hammock getting stuck on something. We also have had to take it out of the hammock and put it in the back of a truck. The hammock is very easy to set up and it is very easy to adjust to your comfort level.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Wuliff Tactical Knife with Foldable Blade - 6  Inch Overall Length, Stainless Steel Pocket Knife, Durable Lightweight Design, Secure Locking Mechanism, Rust Resistant, Ultra-Sharp Blade

Exceptional knife, especially for the price!  Even my husband, who collects knives was impressed with this one.  First off, this foldable tactical knife, by Wuliff, shipped fast, and arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  Knife measures 6.5 inches long by .5 inches by .5 inches, so is a great size for an EDC knife.  Knife is made from stainless steel and is foldable.

The first thing I noticed about this knife, was the design.  It has a nice sleek look to it.  And the handle is comfortable to hold (especially for those, like me, with smaller hands).  Me and my husband both have pocket knives, we carry every day. And we both are avid hikers, campers, outdoors-men, so have quite a few tactical knives.  So, we compared the size and sharpness to those knives (which were double and triple the price of this one).  It was a bit smaller than the knives we were carrying, but this is actually a good thing. It is much more comfortable in your pocket and not bulky, at all.  As far as sharpness,  this was extremely sharp!  I cannot say how long the sharpness will last, or how well it will sharpen back up.  But, after more use and sharpening, I will update this.  Knife is nice and light, yet seems pretty durable.  Have only used it for small jobs, but, so far, it's been great.  Locking mechanism works perfectly and it is easy to open and close.  For the last week, my husband has replaced his regular knife, with this one and loves it.  Is this knife as good as a K-bar or SOG? No, but it also doesn't cost close to those.  For the price, this is a great every day pocket knife.",0

I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with.",0

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Ordered these from Amazon but there was problem with 1-day shipping. Ended up getting them from Peter Glenn, as I needed them in time for a trip. But after experiencing them, I just had to come leave a review. I mostly wear Merino Wool dress socks, as my wardrobe is primarily comprised of suits. However, when I do wear sneakers, I solely wear Viscose socks made from Bamboo, which has a softness similar to or surpassing cashmere socks (depending on the brand), and have become quite spoiled by them. I was looking for a nice pair of Bamboo no-show socks, and I encountered this brand on Amazon. Eye-brow raised, because it had the best of both worlds in the composition (Merino Wool + Bamboo). So I ordered the Ultra-light version, and was surprisingly disappointed because that version was abrasive / scratchy; not soft at all. But there were so many great reviews on these socks, and I noticed there was a thicker version (Ultra-Light versus Light Cushion), so I decided to experiment and give them a try as I thought the thicker version might be softer. Well, I'm glad that I did, because these socks feel great. The feel is very comparable to Cariloha bamboo socks, which is the best pure bamboo viscose brand I've encountered and I've tried tonnes of brands. I'm glad that I tried this brand as Cariloha socks although there is a low cut version, they are not compression socks. Feetures! has the cashmere range level of softness, with the compressive benefits making it the all around best sports sock I've tried. I highly recommend it. My only complaints are that, first the socks are not truly ""no-show"" socks. It's very easy to see the socks, but I like that it doesn't cover my ankles. The other thing is the branding. I would've prefered more subtle branding, perhaps only a symbol / logo, but that's a personal style thing. It does not inhibit nor take away from the experience of the sock.",0

This is a great product and I highly recommend it.I use this as a hiking pack.  The first time I used it I was going to use it as a backpack and I was so excited to use it.  This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.  It is a very good pack for the price.  The belt is made of nylon and the strap is made of a mesh.  The belt loop is pretty tight, but I'm happy with the belt.  I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.  The zipper is nice and thick, but it's not so good that it's going to be uncomfortable for a long time.  I would recommend this pack for the price.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Let me begin by saying my husband and I got married on a really tight budget.  So we've had to think outside the box to have what wealthier folks might take for granted.  One of those areas revolved around our wedding bands.

Originally we had purchased tungsten rings. Wow. Bad move.  Apparently with tungsten you'll lose your finger before you lose your ring.  You can't cut those things off.  And being that my husband works in a very hands on field, I didn't like the idea of him having to lose his finger just because his ring wouldn't come off.

So we have these silicon ones a try. And I must say that I'm in love.  They are SOOO flexible and stylish! They are easy to do work with and I don't worry about losing a stone or anything.  They not only serve the purpose of a ring, but they also take ring wearing on a non-traditional route that I especially appreciate.  And they come in three different colors and these really nice felt bags for storage!  They are super cool! And they are priced so affordably.

But I think the biggest selling factor for me was the customer service.  We were contacted by, who I believe was the owner to make sure we were satisfied with our product.  Wow! For a ring priced for the average person, that was definitely above average service.  That sold it for me.

I highly recommend this ring to anyone who wants to get a nice symbol of your union but on a budget.  We are extremely satisfied with our purchase and hope you will be as well.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"The SOG Fatcat that I received, arrived in a dirty, worn looking presentation box, and the knife had multiple scratches on the bolsters and ornamental metalwork (despite the protective plastic films). At $362. 19 delivered, this is fairly outrageous. I sent it back the very next day. If the Fatcat I received is a NIB (New In Box) knife, then it was carelessly assembled at the factory, without regard to scratching up the bolsters and ornamental metalwork. Honestly, this thing looked like it had spent time in someone else's pocket, amidst loose change and keys. If the knife did indeed leave the factory that way, it is a major breach of consumer trust to put those protective films over scratched and dinged up metal surfaces. In my considerable years, I have never removed a protective film from a new watch crystal, or cell phone screen, or even a new kitchen faucet, to find it scratched up beneath the protective plastic. I have seen this but once before--on Cold Steel Espada XL knives, where protective plastic films were knowingly and unethically placed over scratched and dinged up bolsters. I sent those knives back as well. Obvious defects aside, the knife is impressive, but overpriced. If you just have to have one, then have at it. But if you pay more than $150. 00 for it, dinged up or otherwise, you've paid too much in my opinion. I have another SOG Knife due to be delivered tomorrow. I can only hope that the dinged up Fatcat I received is an anomaly, and not the norm for this OEM. Over the years I have purchased a dozen Spyderco Knives, and I've never been less than satisfied with any of them. The same can be said for Kershaw. In fact, the $80. 00 Handmade Damascus Folding Knife from Perkin Knives, that arrived the same day this SOG Fatcat did, is both beautiful and ostensibly flawless--at less than 1/4 the price!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Living in southern Arizona hats are a must if you are outdoors. It is hot and we have over 300 days of full sun. I own a tone of hats of all shapes and sizes. I was looking for a lighter weight hat I could wear under my bicycle helmet and for other sport activities. I have a mountain hardware hat that works well but does not have an adjustable strap to cinch it down tighter and the brim is smaller than this one. This hat works well to fill the gap for me. The material is definitely light weight without having a fragile too thin feel and the brim is full sized. The adjustable strap on the back is elastic so it has some flex to it and you can cinch it down as tight or loose as you want. One unique thing about this cap is that the adjustment strap has a clasp on it. I will attach a photo. The clasp is thin so it doesnt bother me even when worn under my bicycle helmet and if you have a pony tail you could unclip the strap and then clip it around you pony tail without having to pull it through like you are probably used to. This is the first hat I have seen with this feature. Very clever. The has is made from a synthetic material so it doesnt hold sweat or moisture and drys very quickly as a result. It has ventilation mesh on the sides to help it keep your head cool. It is not the thinnest or lightest hat I own but is close.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.

The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster.",0

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.",0

I got these from Amazon for free, but I'd be happy to send them back for free again.

I'm glad I found these.  They're very soft and comfortable.  They're a bit difficult to put on and take off, but I've been using them for a few months now and have no issues with them getting in the way.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"Let me start by saying that this is an awesome knife for the money.  I have one in my family and the other in my office.  The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.

One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists.  I'll see how it holds up, but for now I'm happy with this knife.  I also liked the way it looks and feels.  I'm giving it five stars because it's very sturdy.

UPDATE:  The knife has been back in the USA and I haven't had to return it yet.  I'm very happy with it. ",1
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"This is an exact OEM replacement for my 24V/80lb iPilot Riptide ST, and presumably other similar models.  This is a great unit and meets my every expectation.

Linking is snap.  Hit the learn button on the head of the iPilot and hit any button on the remote.  You will get a confirmation beep.  That's it.

This stays on as long as your iPilot is on.  As the remote battery ages, the remote will go to sleep on you.  This is normal. I have never experienced any other disconnection or difficulty with linking with the original remote or this replacement.  When the remote goes to sleep, the trolling motor keeps doing whatever it was doing.

If you are having trouble linking remote or are losing connection (other than the sleep mode to save battery on the remote), it is more likely that your iPilot unit is going bad.  Keep that in mind before you throw this product under the bus.  These remotes are solid as a rock.

I recommend having at least two methods to control your trolling motor.  This remote plus the foot pedal, or two of these remotes, or one of these remote and one mini remote, etc.  Also, having a couple extra batteries on board is a good idea.  The batteries last me about 10-12 months with moderate use, and replacements can store unused for 3 years or more.  You do get some warning that the battery is dying, but not super accurate.

This does not include the fancy Minn Kota lanyard.  The product description does not say that it is included.  Minn Kota website does not say it is included.  I don't know where people are getting the idea that this product brings the lanyard.  To be clear, this product does not bring the lanyard.  It is the remote unit with the battery installed.  That's it.  Do not take away stars from an otherwise stellar product because you wanted more that was supposed to come with the product.",0

My wife and I have used them many times and we always use them. We have tried them on our mamma bike, and we always love them. They seem to be very durable and last much longer than any other brand we have tried. The material is very durable and the colors are very vibrant. It is really easy to adjust and change colors. I also think that the padding is a little snug for my wife and her wrist, but that is because she is in the wheelchair.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund.",0
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,CG,"I bought this light on a whim and thought it would be a nice addition to my bike. It is so bright and bright I am able to see the light from the side and it is easy to adjust to fit in the trunk of my car. This light is excellent. The light is bright enough to see my bike and it also has a low profile on the front so you don't have to worry about it falling off. The light is bright enough to see when I am riding in the dark and it is easy to see when I am out in the dark. I am 6' and 185 lbs and the light is great for someone with a large head. It is a good size and I like that it does not have any rubber pads or striping. It is also light enough to be worn under your clothing. It does not have any screws to hold the light down or anything like that. It does not have the polarized reflector. It is a good deal for a single source light and it is good enough for someone who is always looking for a bright light to use when riding on the road. It does not come with any locking or locking mechanisms and I can't see anything from the outside.

I have a large head and this light is perfect for me. I am 5'11"" and my head is a little long so I am not too big. I am 6'5"" and it fits perfectly.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area.",0

I picked this up for my 9 year old who loves playing baseball. Is he the best player on his team? No. He wants so badly to play shortstop, but isn't the best fielder. He was getting discouraged about always playing in the outfield. He has improved with team practices, but really has no one to help him to practice at home. This net has been amazing because he can go out by himself and throw and catch the ball for HOURS by himself. In a few short days he has already improved his fielding skills and is eager to show them off to coach before his next game.

It was incredibly easy to put together. All the pieces are labeled ON THE ACTUAL PIECE, so once you take it out of the plastic you can STILL identify it exactly which piece it is. One piece had the ""snap"" on the wrong side so it's not exactly ""snapped"" into place, but it still holds. I double checked the instructions and it just looks like I got a wacky piece.  The net goes on easy. Once you get a rhythm down it's easy to snap on without pinching any fingers, but still be careful.

The instructions also include instructions on where to throw the ball for which types of rebounds.

As amazing as this product is, I only rated it 4 stars for because of the wonky piece that doesn't snap and because it's not very compact making storage an issue. The kick stand is the only thing that folds (which keeps the net nice and tight.) This is something you will need a large space to store as it is large and wavy. We will be storing our in our garage against the wall. It's no big deal, really, but I know some want small and portable--but this isn't it.

I've attached a video of my son using the net. My other son is the cheerleading voice you hear rooting for him.",0
