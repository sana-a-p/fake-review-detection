It is almost reminiscent of the original Scary Movie in that it doesn't just make random pop culture references but actually spoofs and parodies the source material.  Combining The Walking Dead, Zombieland, and Warm Bodies; this movie crafts a fun plot with great comedic timing and acting.

At times (Poe) could come off as being too brash.  But inevitably, you wound up feeling sorry for him.

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

The story follows a couple who find themselves in the middle of a strange and bizarre world where the world is very different from the one they grew up in. The story is told in a rather idyllic manner with no strong male characters or overly dramatic action scenes. The ending is rather predictable as the characters are forced to take on new lives and responsibilities and to go through some difficult times.

It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure with significant elements of comedy.  To a certain extent it brings to mind Next of Kin starring Patrick Swayze.

Woody Harrelson, Kiefer Sutherland, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

There are some amusing moments - and one sight gag (a la Keystone Cops) that is overused.

When Ben is accepted at the police academy, James decides to take him on a 'ride along' to show him what the police world is really like. Throughout the day, James gives Ben silly assignments that no one else wants. It all leads up to a confrontation with Omar, the main villain that James is obsessed with catching. If you want a good comedy, I highly recommend RIDE ALONG!!!",0

Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season.

Watching the progression and destruction of these characters you feel as if you yourself are the addict and as the brilliance in shot composition deteriorates so does the characters and audience members along the way. You feel and see what the feel and see and you feel the hunger and desperation for their chosen vice. A beautifully heartbreaking portrayal of addiction and destruction that left me completely engrossed, repelled, and sucked dry of all emotion by the end of the rollercoaster of a film.",0

I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece depicting yet another episodic take on the seemingly never-ending conflict between Good and Evil...

Combining a pristine and innocent imagination with the heart and soul of a poet, the young heroine Ofelia is seemingly over-matched against the consummate evil of Fascism that has possessed Franco's Spain.  Unable to match their firepower, Ofelia turns to imagination and magic instead.  Del Torro leaves it to the discretionary viewer to decide where fantasy ends and magical reality begins.

Within the magical fantastic occurrences between Ofelia and her fantasy/magical beings are contained lessons in life given to the all-too-human Ofelia.  They provide not only a means of escape but of real life survival, which strongly argues for more than the products of a young but gifted girl's prodigious imagination.

But he still does a good job and the band is absolutely smoking. And it's amazing how well the orchestra integrates with the band by adding a whole new dimension of depth, complexity, power and freshness to these songs. And where else could you hear a call and response duel between Steve Morse on guitar and the conductor on violin (Lazy). I don't know how they are going to top this one. For my money this is the best Deep Purple concert ever.",0

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

Jack nearly steals the show as O'Neill, a man very much in love with Bryant despite the fact that her heart really belongs to Reed.

The dialog occasionally felt like it had been pulled right out of a novel without nearly enough of the back story you would find in the novel to justify it. I imagine it would feel okay to someone who had read the novel but in the movie it was sometimes insufficient to suspend belief. That being said I really enjoyed the movie for the most part. I would watch another with this character.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Thunderball feels like the first three early bond films somehow rolled perfectly, cohesively, and successfully into one new original and spectacular film. The movie overall seems balanced with its drama, action, story, and other elements. So it feels like the ultimate Bond movie (Peter Hunt's 'On Her Majesy's Secret Service' is the perfect and excellent closer of the early Bond films).

The intricate and well-developed plot, involving the heist of the two atomic bombs, seems very believable. The cinematography is highly exceptional - there was nothing like the great underwater battle sequences ever done before. The incredible set designs by Ken Adams were marvelously ultra-modern and still look new. And of course, Peter Hunt by this time had perfected the 'jump-cut' editing on this 4th of the great early James Bond films.

Also, a big tip-of-the-hat to director Terence Young, who was more than partially responsible for the savvy and sophistication of the Bond character.",0

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.

Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This is an intriguing documentary. It doesn't defend the practice of bestiality, but instead makes viewers acknowledge that zoophiles are utterly human, not evil or sinister. This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

I recommend this film to anyone who is fascinated by sexuality or who seeks to understand outsiders.",0

There is no discernible story worth caring about and NONE of the actors roused me to root for or care about them. The movie just goes on insufferably from one disconnected, disjointed scene to the next.

There is no structure to this film other than a loose stream of scenes and unattractive people, especially Sgt. Yu who's supposed to be so hot everybody wants her. She's sullen, somber, withdrawn, sour, and even that is limp and lame.

Occasionally inspired cinematography, some nice little shots, small vignettes, nothing any film school grad should not be able to do.

I'm out of stuff to write about. NOTHING here. NOTHING going on. I turned it off at 48 minutes.

In fairness, in reading the other reviews, it seems Asian fans and others got a lot more out of it than I did, so maybe it's cultural. OK, so I'm old school, USA---REALLY Old School.

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion.

The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.  The film becomes a talkie only when the action takes place after talkies were invented.",0

Yet, knowing this, this meticulously restored yarn stands entirely alone in thought-provoking suspense, cat-and-mouse deception and thought. Cambridge Prof. Smith is traveling through Germany in wartime with a handful of students while a mysterious man rescues endangered scientists, intellectuals. Are they connected and how? The way Leslie Howard embodies this earlier Indiana Jones archaeologist so completely with all the thrills of his original Scarlet Pimpernel (disguises/surprises) yet takes on fully the seriousness of the Nazi threat to humanity with witty and thought-provoking dialogue places this above most WWII yarns. Added to the Gestapo pressures is an added tension of a cagey female (Mary Morris) pursuer seeking the identity of this war-time savior.

The father quietly goes about his woodworking and lets the action play out. Along with this family scenario, Madeline seeks out a backwoods artist to sign for her gallery. This creates a conflict when a crisis in the pregnancy draws the family together, while Madeline tends to business. The film is marred by too many scenes with low lighting make the viewer guess what's going on with whom. Additionally many scenes are muttered through and possibly key information gets missed.

And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty. I've had one hospital birth, two home-births, with a third at the end of this year. I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth.",0

However, when I first saw this film, I felt that I'd missed something, and I'm not sure why. I was a little disappointed by the fact that this film doesn't have a lot of great dialogue, and the actors in the film do a great job of portraying them perfectly.

A Tough Winter
Pups Is Pups
Teacher's Pet
School's Out
Helping Grandma
Love Business
Little Daddy
Bargain Day
Fly My Kite
Big Ears

Jackie Cooper shines here as he falls for his teacher Miss Crabtree and has to compete with Chubby Chaney in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""School's Out"" & ""Love Business"".
Wheezer takes the main stage in ""Pups IS Pups"" but the early gang is all there as they invade an animal show with their exotic pets.
The gang's love for an elderly lady who acts as their Grandmother is heartwarming yet great fun in ""Helping Grandma"" & ""Fly My Kite"".
One clinker here is ""Big Ears"" which is a melodrama dealing with divorce.

Over all Volume 2 is much stronger than Volume 1, it is apparent that the Hal Roach Studios have become comfortable with their new sound apparatus and can now focus on producing funny comedies again.

I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.

For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.

This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"This movie was a pure waste of time - the story lacks originality as its basic premise of good fighting evil seems to be a rehash of other famous fantasy classics like LOTR. Director Uwe Boll who also gave us movies like BloodRayne seems bent on insulting viewer's sensibilities by producing fantasy movies that lack originality.

The basic premise here - Jason Statham (The Transporter) plays Farmer, a simple laborer who gets embroiled in an epic battle of good versus evil when Duke Fallow (Matthew Lillard) conspires with a magician named Gallian (Ray Liotta) to overthrow King Konreid (Burt Reynolds). There are other familiar names in the cast -Leelee Sobieski, John Rhys-Davies, Ron Perlman, Claire Forlani, Kristanna Loken, Brian J. White , all of whom add little to pique one's interest in the movie.

The acting on the whole is pretty average, and the Krugs look like they are a poor imitation of the Orcs from LOTR. All in all, this comes across as a cheap, uninspired knock-off of other fantasy classics and is not worth wasting one's money on. I would recommend passing on this one.",0

This is a character study that almost feels like a stage play: every scene is set and paced to take the viewer deeper and deeper into this hidden and bleak world.

  Viewing this film over Amazon prime was a treat. Although in B&W, it was very sharp and very close to true Blu-ray image quality. Of course with any movie enhanced by the Blu-ray process there is always something one never noticed before that catches the eye.

Lifeboat is a simple tale: a ship has gone down, torpedoed by a German U-Boat that was destroyed soon after. A number of survivors struggle to a lifeboat, one of whom is a crewman from the U-Boat. Second-guessing, paranoia, and power struggles ensue. The best thing to do: get out of the way.

Germany before and during WWII was not a cartoon character, and serious study must be undertaken to understand Prussia and Germany.  If USA citizens knew the history of the German States their attitude towards Germany would change dramatically.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This series is amazing! Even if it only has a handful of episodes, it's so well-plotted and most of the characters are amazingly acted. Heather was underutilized, but I won't get into that for brevity and sanity's sake. I think the best part of the show is that it has a rich cast of characters that bring all different perspectives of society into play. You have the mayor and family, the farmer, the orphaned teen, the school teacher, the government agent, the cops, etc. It's not just focused on one person, and each sect of characters has its own issues. This is especially true of the first season. It also deals with the nuclear fallout issues realistically. Did you know that acid rain would be a problem after a nuclear explosion happened miles away?
 I didn't, but the writers did. They made an effort to make things as realistic as possible. Maybe not perfect, but pretty darn close. Definitely worth purchasing and watching if you enjoy well acted and well-crafted stories. It ends slightly open ended, but it brings closure, so don't worry about that aspect of it.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim.
Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"""Laurel Canyon"" is an entrancing languid film about the intersection of individuals and lifestyles.
Briefly, the film covers the relationship between a young professional couple who have been studying at Harvard played by (Sam) Christian Bale and (Alex) Kate Beckinsale and the lifestyle of Sam's record producer mother Jane (Frances Mc Dormand) and her younger boyfriend Ian (Allesandro Nivola).  The Harvard culture is conservative and polite whereas Jane's Los Angeles culture is uninhibited and hedonistic.  Sam is embarrassed by his mother while Alex is slowly drawn in like a moth to a flame.
The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film.",0

In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films where the characters are never sure what is real and what is a dream (or computer-generated fantasy). Vanilla Sky also has some David Lynch-like features, as when people's identities seem to randomly morph. Unlike Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive, however, Cameron Crowe's story at least offers an explanation for the confusion. The explanation won't satisfy everyone (as some of the harsh criticism of the film shows), but to focus too much on this is to miss the point, which is to make us ponder some big questions regarding truth and reality.

He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.

I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.

It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...

I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when Stephen chimed in on Willie Nelson's homage to xmas weed.  It's a direct musical quote from the strangest xmas duet of all time --- David Bowie and Bing Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy.  YouTube it.  It was surreal then, it's surreal now.  Hats off to the songwriters.  Very, very clever all the way around.  And Jon Stewart!!  What a gem!  (""And now, for the Hannukah portion of the show . . ."" to quote Mrs. Rene from Pee Wee's show.)

- The presentation could have been better.  The background & lighting is drab with a crinkly velvet curtain that distracts the eyes from following her movement. And in parts she seems too absorbed in following her movements in the mirror in front of her rather than demonstrating a movement to the viewer.
- The filming has been done from behind and the sideway. So you don't really get to see a good full view of each movement. And unless you zoom in the dvd player, you can not clearly see a front view of the movements in the mirror in front of which she demonstrates the moves.
- The moves are demonstrated in isolation and there is not enough explanations for each movement as if she is careful not to give too much away.  No combination of movements demonstrated.

Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.

I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.

Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she receives from drunks, thugs and hoodlums that invade her home. Watch Olivia de Havilland's face in the final fade out, however, and you'll realize that these events represent a woman being forced to re-evaluate her life.

Previously the focus of her life had been the adored, pampered, 30 year old son who lived with her.  During her caged ordeal she learns that her son wants to leave home, taking half the contents of the safe.  If his wishes are not met, he will shoot himself.

Hitherto, the woman had been living in a kind of enclosed world, unchanging, suspended between two levels of reality.  Now, however, miraculously freed from it, is the world outside the ""cage"" a better one?  Her home is trashed, she has been beaten up by a thug, and her son is threatening suicide.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters.",0

The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection.

I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects.",0

The artistry is within every frame. There is one interview documentry with Bergman in 1998 with one of his assocites, it is clear that as Bergman got older and older, he wanted to dis-associate himself from these early acheivements. Why? He states that although he knew he was master of the medium (and theater as well)that his personal life, was just a series of bitter disappointments ending with the death of his last wife, Ingrid I beleive. So, he assumed himself to be just an anonymous technician, or at least that's what he wished. The only compliant I have is that the subtitles are inside of the visual image instead of being letter boxed and the subtitles are sloppily inserted. Not up to Criterion criteria. One new observation is that the ensamble cast that Bergman uses throughout most of these films are one of the reasons these movies are the classics that they are.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

Needless to say, the documentation of queer history is sorely lacking. Fortunately the American Experience, which always delivers perfect, entertaining yet respectable productions of historical American time capsules, has approached this subject/story of when gay men and women in America stood up to the police (and the mafia) and said ""No more"".  This production delivers the story of how the current Gay Rights Movement erupted in New York City in 1969.

You get much more than just the Stonewall Inn story.  You get a development of the story of a certain treatment of a certain group of people only rivaled by the horrific trials suffered by the Jews during the holocaust. That may sound dramatic to some, but if you objectively step back and look at the entire history of the treatment of homosexuals in human history, you'll agree that the methodic efforts to obliterate this sector of society has been continuous and is still alive today.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"""First Blood"" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time. I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama. Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars). Stallone actually does some acting in this film. His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic. There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable. Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy. He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop. My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels. Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion. If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love ""First Blood.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This movie is my favorite ever. The scenery is beautiful, the acting is extraordinary, the narration is poetic. Babette's feast is not some ""movie with a message"" otherwise it wouldn't be any good. But it's so real and poignant that much truth can be seen in it, spiritual truth and insights which shed light onto human nature. The relationships are very natural and believable, but the style of narration keeps the story from any kind of overly-subjective viewpoint which infects many movies which delve into human relationships. The actions and conversations arise very naturally and advance the plot superbly.
Another thing which I love about the movie is that it reveals something about the nature of good, evil, grace and redemption. None of the acting characters in the movie are ""evil""; however many are infected with smaller sins of pettiness, lack of generosity, glorying in the defeat of others, scrupulosity, jealousy, etc. This movie shows how these defects - small but many - have taken all the joy and pleasure out of life for those suffering under them and that to forgive and be forgiven is necessary to restore the joy of life. Grace, in this case the gift of Babette, is necessary to occasion the redemptive action.",0

It is one thing to capture the virtuosity of Streep, but to present the trials and tribulations of innocent, accused parents under the microscope of media and bombarded by innuendo at every turn wearing testimony and beliefs to the pressure point is an extraordinary piece of cinema.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Judy Holiday won an Oscar for this film, and no wonder: her performance of Billie Dawn, a ""dumb broad"" who suddenly wises up in a most unexpected way, is certainly one of the finest and most original film performances in 20th Century American cinema. The story, from the stage success, concerns a crass junk yard tycoon (Broderick Crawford) who goes to Washington to buy a Senator--and promptly considers that his blonde-bimbo mistress Billie Dawn (Holiday) lacks enough poise for such refined circles.  He accordingly entices a reporter (William Holden) to ""smarten her up.""  But things soon get out of hand: once her mind is awakened, Billie Dawn begins to perceive her lover and his political intrigues in a very different light.
The comedy is genuine, and Crawford and Holden are as memorable as Holiday herself.  But there is some serious stuff behind the hilarity: issues of personal integrity, honesty, and civic duty become increasingly important as Billie evolves, and ultimately she must make a choice between her old life and a new one.  The film very neatly balances its comic elements with its serious side, and neither predominate nor throw the film off center; director Cukor steers a perfect course.  A must-see and a must-own.",0

But acceptance is not Henenlotter's purpose here.  His aim as usual is to entertain, shock, and amuse, and he attains his goals on his accustomed shoe-string budget.

Indeed, part of the fun of this DVD is listening to the commentary, in which the outre auteur and his young white-boy-rapper producer describe the guerilla movie-making techniques they employed to realize this bizarre sexual fantasy.  The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!

It was fun to watch from start to finish. 2 gangs go up against each other in an all out duel in a roller ring shoot out,then wild in the streets with the help of a black panther female run like gang. The one gang called The Silver Daggers  reminded me of a greaser stlye gang with the leather jackets and switch blade knives,also complete with a girl that has an eye patch(she lost an eye in a fight of course).Really just over the top and unrealistic but so much fun with action and dialouge that seemed to come off of the pages of a comic book. The Dagger Debs(the gangs girlfriends) kick the guys out of their own gang the Silver Daggers(they think maybe these guys are too soft) after their leader gets knocked off in a roller rink shootout. Then the girls change their gangs name to the Jezebells and go out to seek revenge for their dead leader and go up agaisnt their rival .There happens to be a rift among the Jezebell girls as there might be a traitor or traitors within their she gang.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This Swedish comedy is set in 1970 and takes a look at life in a commune in Stockholm. Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) runs away from her drunken husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist), after he hits her in the face, taking along her 13-year-old daughter and son who is eight or nine. They land up with Elizabeth's brother who lives in a hippie commune where the members are all committed to socialism, vegetarianism, feminism and open-marriage but cannot agree whose turn it is to do the washing up.

The poor kids feel humiliated and estranged among a bunch of immature adults -- and their father's efforts to win back their trust only make things worse. But slowly they begin forming relationships with other kids their own age. Meanwhile Elizabeth is introduced to feminist ideas expressed by the radical notion of allowing her underarm hair to grow. We soon learn that behind the empty slogans of the hippies lies deep hypocrisy -- and we eventually learn what it takes to form a real community bound by ties of love and affection. Along the way there are many funny moments.

What I liked about this movie, apart from the Abba soundtrack, is that the characters change and grow -- and that the ideological points it makes are delivered subtly instead of being hammered home.",0

I'm writing this as I'm almost done watching the program on 'mute'.  I frankly couldn't take the insipid palaver.  For about two minutes at the beginning, I was hoping the pap-y-talk would change to something informative or smarm-free.  It didn't.

Here's proof that a fairly accomplished actor with a British inflection can't actually keep up with stunning cinematography when trying too hard to say grammatically correct but meaningless, flowery verbiage.  The attempt to sound poetic is pathetic.  This production is the 'nature' equivalent of the Roman Polansky film Tess (1979) - Gorgeously shot, lifeless, bland, and numbingly tedious.  You find yourself wishing that something would happen.  It doesn't, but Michael York drones on relentlessly anyway.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"`Intacto', the Spanish language film directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is an ingenious take on an idea seemingly borrowed from `The Deer Hunter', with a bit of subtle sci-fi theming worthy of Rod Serling's `The Twilight Zone'. The impact of the supernatural theme is made convincing by the appearance of the great Max Von Sydow in an important supporting role. His appearance in all those spooky early Ingemar Bergman movies makes his character all that more credible.

The story is a bit thin. All the interest in the movie revolves around the characters' participation in highly dangerous, some even fatal games of chance, much like the Russian roulette theme from `The Deer Hunter'. While the attraction in `The Deer Hunter' is purely an addiction to the thrill of the risk, the attraction is both more subtle and stronger in `Intacto'.

I'm a big fan of the director's commentary on movies like this, but I found the commentary just a bit thin here. It did very little to explain the basic premise, it's development, or its origins.

The movie is not as deep or as emotionally involving as Bergman's `The Magician' or `The Virgin Spring' or Fellini's `La Dolce Vita'. The characters are thrill seekers with little depth, but the subtly supernatural premise and the way the story is told makes the trip interesting.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Today, almost everyone has heard of Billy Graham, but not everybody knows his early history--or ""the rest of the story"", as Paul Harvey liked to say.  This DVD tells the rest of that story, and it was very interesting.

The narrative begins with Billy Graham as a young man living at his parent's home, and how he came to be called into the ministry.  We also learn about the person he almost married, and the one he did--and how he met her.  We see how one of Billy Graham's very best friends in the ministry lets him down, and then ridicules him publicly.  It is very easy to identify with Billy Graham in the different situations portrayed.

This movie definitely keeps your interest, some parts are funny and some are sad.  Even if Billy Graham were not a public figure, this would be an account worth watching.  Even though there were not any big name actors in this film, it was well done and enjoyable.  I am a long-time admirer of Dr. Graham, and came forward at one of his crusades when I was twelve years old.  Learning Dr. Graham's history made me respect him even more.

The movie is suitable for all ages and clean.  Our family highly recommends this, and gives it five stars.",0

So I figured it would suck and give Jurassic Park a bad name. I was wrong. This one had the most action and was the most intense one in the series. I would give it 5 stars,but you just can't compare it to to the previous two. I was real glad to see Sam Neil return as Dr. Grant. He may not be the most popular actor, but he's a good one. The special effects were great as usual. ""The Lost World's"" visuals weren't a whole lot better than the first one, but you can tell a significant difference in Jurassic Park III. The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts. For one example, the ending when the army and Navy showed up to rescue them. It was to unrelistic. The movie is still great though. It's a great conclusion and ending to a wonderful movie series.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This movie is wonderfully simple and sincere in presenting its message. The story is based on the life of Patrick ""Tyler"" Doherty. It presents the question ""Why God?"" Here is an upright church-going family, where firstly the father and main bread winner dies unexpectedly, and then the younger of two brothers is diagnosed with a rare breed of brain cancer, that is quite aggressive.

Most Christians believe in divine healing, but what is the response supposed to be when a much needed healing does not take place in the life of a young innocent boy? This is the scenario that is presented. Each member of the family suffers from the pressure of this situation and Tyler's grandmother steps in as a source of help and encouragement.

Tyler keeps his faith and starts writing his letters to God in order to keep his perspective of things and those around him. In an apparent answer to one of these letters, a new postman shows up and befriends the family. He has his own family challenges, but Tyler's resolve and determination motivates him not up give up on trying to solve his own personal problems.

This film is very moving emotionally, it will make most people cry and will keep you hoping and believing. The message rings true to the end, hold on to Jesus no matter the outcome.",0

Writer/director Chad Ferrin (Someone's Knocking At the Door) is quickly establishing himself as a cult horror stud.  This movie is darn near perfect, melding violence, nudity, and touches of dark comedy with some very likeable protagonists and despicable villains.  Just some great writing, acting, pacing, characters, camerawork, bloody effects--this is all done in a very stylish, original fashion.

It's Easter time.  Mindy is the single mother of her 16-yr-old son Nicholas, who is mentally-disabled and has a hard time coping with the loss of his father.  When Mom brings home her new boyfriend Remington, the young kid instinctually puts up the red flag.  Then when Mindy leaves for work, we get to see first hand what a total scumbag this dude really is.  He invites over some prostitutes and other degenerate sleazeball buddies and the party is about to get bloody.  A mysterious killer in a bunny mask is ready to hunt, and it's more than Easter eggs that are going to dye.

Easter Bunny Kill! Kill! is undeniably a spectacular low budget gem!  4.5 stars.  Highly recommended to all you fans of deranged blood-splattered cinematic chaos and mayhem.",0

""The Frontier House series tells the story of these three families. Our cast of characters (or actual people in this case) includes the Clune family, the Glenn family and the Brooks family. The Clunes are, essentially, rich people (two adults and four children) from Malibu who live in a mansion. The Glenns (two adults and two children) are a middle class, church going family from Tennessee. The Brooks are something of an evolving family. They start out as a young man and his father, and become a young man and his new bride two months into the project. The families are very different in background and personality, making for some very interesting, not to mention entertaining, community interaction."" (from epinions)

Quite similar to the famous master of manga, Osmau Tezuka's  ""Knight of Ribbons"" where a young princess dresses up in a male  garb to embark on a soul-searching odyssey, Utena with her cotton  candy-pink hair and sparkling blue eyes dons a boy's school uniform and  dates the other girls at a very swanky academy school where young children  of the mythical land attend. Then Utena meets a very mysterious black girl  with startling green eyes and lavendar curls at a rose-choked greenhouse  where she tends to the colorful flowers. And Utena sees her get slapped  around. So she challenges the tormenter to a duel, which would take place  in the great ivory arena up in the heavens right underneath a floating  inverted castle. And wins. Thus the ""Rose Bride"" quite gratefully  throws herself at Utena's feet - much to her unwillingness to claim her. A  very misty-eyed fantasy tale filled with princely (princessly?) heroism,  chivalric romance, theatrical drama, lots of swashbuckling action, ideal  visions of innocent childhood and adolescent rebellion, and lesbian  suggestions.

Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"I'm a Huge fan of Will & Grace. I think it is without a doubt one of the best shows on TV. That said this season was about 50/50, and for a show that's previous seasons were 90/10 that doesn't say much. This season for some reason the shows creators decided it was time for Grace to get married. They chose Harry Connick Jr. as her love interest Leo. This decision threw the show completely off the course, and in my eyes changed what the show was about. Two friends.....It became more about Grace getting married, being a newlywed, and trying to deal with a husband that wasn't around quite so much. Karen and Jack remain hilarious as always. Jack continues his career of being a struggleing actor and Karen divorces Stan after discovering he was having an affair with Minnie Driver who was suprisingly HILARIOUS.

The one thing that I will say about this season is that it has some of the funniest episodes of the series. Mainly the season finale which features Karen, Will, Grace, and Jack putting Stan to rest at sea. Without giving away too too much two of the characters go overboard, someone might be cheating, and two characters end up in bed together. By far one of the funniest episodes EVER!

Good show, and just a ok season.....Still worth the buy!",0

But the film's most famous film is the fight between the two leads, played by Christopher Walken and Keanu Reeves, as they are trying to overcome the two men who are leaving a woman in a wheelchair to save her mother.

The film is so brutal that it is difficult to understand why it took Reeves so long to get the film off the air.  But it is a compelling one.

""The Hood"" is one of those films where the camera is shooting it's moments of terror.  The film is shot with great accuracy, and the actors are superb as they take to the screen to make the film feel real.  I've seen it many times before, and I never saw it as a horror film.

Costners plays his flawed character well although his portrayal feels a bit more subdued than I expected. To me though Estill, who played the little girl Eloise, really played her role well. This is a movie that tries to tell a story that is a shade of gray and not clear cut with everyone involved having some character flaws of their own. There are some emotional moments but at times the movie feels a bit flat and slow moving and the story failed to really connect me to the characters and pull me at the heartstrings that I expected it to do so. It almost seemed to me that they tried too hard to be a bit grey in their story at times with the lack of character development that made it feel a bit superficial. Maybe it was because I watched McFarland USA and I am comparing this too much, I don't know. This is not a bad movie by any means as it is a good family movie that can start a conversation but it does seem to lack something that could make it more. 3 to 3.",0

30 years can show a lot of age on some movies but Annie is a breath of fresh air for a catalog title. The films 2.40:1 framed production design and muted color scheme shines bright and clear with a beautiful restoration. The picture maintains a wonderful film-like appearance with a solid grain structure that maintains depth and detail without compromising black levels.

This movie is possibly the closest you could get to experiencing what life could possibly be on another planet. I was constantly amazed at the little details like a shrinking plant, a lizard with a parachute thing, bio-connection with other lifeforms and so many other little things within the movie.

The story was not too unique and from a sci-fi perspective, there are better stories out there (Enders Game for example). But what this movie has done is to create a benchmark for a new genre of 3D computer generated movies. The benchmark being both in detail and production quality.

This is possibly the first time I have seen a movie where despite a lukewarm story, I still was 100% focused on the movie and left the theater with the feeling of having experienced a new civilization. It took me some time to digest all that I saw within this movie and I may do another trek to the theater to look at the finer details in the forests once more.

Apparently the movie was never a big success in the US, which could be because the subject is too close for comfort.

It brings to mind the story by Gurdjieff of the evil magician, as the movie shows how Truman is really not in control of anything, as it is all orchestrated from above. Just like we like to think we are at the top of the food chain and in control of our lives, so too does Truman believe that he makes real choices and that he is free. Little does he know that he is lives in a ""cage"". To keep Truman from discovering the Truth, the ""media"" is employed to constantly shape his opinions and to suppress any questioning of the reality in which he lives. This has scary parallels to todays world, where the mainstream media and manufactured opinion polls acts like the ancient Greek chorus in shaping public opinion the way the controllers wish it to be.

As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.

However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.

If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago.",0

In fact, it is not an 'amazing' movie - don't expect a masterpiece - but it is not bad by any way of measurement. Of-course, the flim 'deals' with the stereotype of working mothers, but before you write it off as predictable feminism the character Kate Reddy (played by Sarah you know who) comes across as a genuine, nice person. Even though Kate has an up-market jobs, a lot of the problems she faces are universal - lack of time to spend with kids, boss calling you in to work when you thought you had a special night with the partner, jealous colleagues and the like.

Unfortunately, her friend Allison is trotted out to give the hard-line men-hate-us mantra now and then, and the film tries to mock stay-at-home mothers; as if stereotyping stay-at-home mothers will 'break' the working-mother stereotype. But they recover that with good interplay between SJP and Pierce Brosnan, as Kate deals with a flirtatious but supportive superior.

You leave this movie feeling sorry for the situation Kate finds herself in, and the plight of the modern working people who are rushing through life, but some of the other characters are a bit one-dimensional and are meant to be demeaning, although it was only ever meant to be comical.",0

She and George get along about as well as nails and a chalkboard and George, who is likable because hes such a charming non-threatening putz, relies on Lucy for every little detail revealing a self-doubting self-deprecating man that begins to change as hes challenged by Lucys strengths and conscience. The two become unlikely friends at some point, and then they realize that they really care about each other. George the playboy cant really deal with his feelings in straightforward fashion and so hurts Lucy who determines to give her two weeks notice (oho! theres the title). In the end George grows some and stands up to his older brother and parents, but is he too late to regain the woman he loves? Its a likable love story set in NYC and the narrative sticks tight to Bullock and Grant. They end up having some real chemistry.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"I was super-excited about the original films being released on Blu-ray......until the news arrived that Lucas was further altering them by adding new dialogue.

While the whole ""NOOOO!"" sequence has been much-ballyhooed by viewers, it did somewhat fit in 'Sith.'  For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)

Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.  It is a cultural phenomenon that has forever changed film and the lives of fans.

I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.

There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.

It's a delightful interpretation of what Twain's lecture series performances would have been like. I particularly enjoy this performance because of the artistry of Mr. Holbrook's interpretation and delivery of Twain: Twain was supposedly the master of the comic pause for effect, and Holbrook seems a fine practitioner of that art.

Much of the material was familiar to me from reading Twain. Yet the performance certainly adds another dimension to one's enjoyment of Mark Twain's high art of civilized comedy and truthful commentary on the human condition. It is a comedy that is merciful to what is sincere and merciless to what is false - always seasoned with humility. It is a comedy, that with exceptions such as Garrison Keillor, modern America has forgotten. Twain's honesty, perspicacity, humility, and irreverence were what made him the luminary he was: The majority of modern comics only score one out of four on that list.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Barbet Schroeder is a very talented director. His main concerns have always been related with the dark side of the human soul.

This singular movie is a very careful analysis of the human psyche seen under a prism. Schroeder would have minutely followed the traces of ""The crime considered as one of the finest arts"" , the smart essay of Thomas de Quincey. Hitchcock, certainly inspired himself to make his famous movie: ""The Rope"".

But if you analyze the smart script with major intensity, you will find clever clues, like the first shot, in that enraptured camera movement that came into the hall window reminds us to: Psycho.

But there is still more, the well known mechanism of oppression and subjection between this weird couple is expressed with genuine fineness through expressive narrative ellipsis.

On the other hand we have to Sandra Bullock' s character who decides to investigate them through the night with a camera; which suggests us a modern Peeping Tom; I mean: James Stewart's role in ""The rear window"".

And finally we have the climatic sequence is another glorious tribute to ""Vertigo"". If you take into account all these hidden traces you will have to admit only Schroeder avoided this thriller had reached so higher peaks.

Perhaps, the only default of the movie resides in the limited scale of psychological grimaces of Sandra Bullock, but this is a minor failure in this intelligently unusual thriller.",0

There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments.

Novarro was a matinee idol at MGM during the silent era; in 1922, after filming ""The Prisoner of Zenda,"" MGM executives brought him into their studio as the Latin lover after the sudden and unexpected demise of Rudolph Valentino. Novarro had only two years in his contact with MGM when he did ""The Cat and the Fiddle."" Novarro offers a brilliant performance as Victor Florescu, a talented, Brussels-based composer of serious music under the tutelage of respected Professor Bertier. When he meets beautiful Shirley Sheridan (MacDonald), a New Yorker living in Brussels as a professional Opera singer, the two bohemians fall in love. The story is a musical comedy and the songs from the Kern-Harbaugh stage musical comedy is used largely intact. Jeanette MacDonald's ""The Night Was Made for Love"" later became a big hit. This pre-code film is not without controversy with regards to the moral codes, since MacDonald and Navarro are portrayed as live-in companions.

Many movie critics and fans were used to Novarro in silent movies and they were less enthusiastic about his talkie movies. In fact some of the greatest silent stars of MGM had difficulty making success when talkies came along. I for one enjoyed this romantic comedy tremendously.

Enough uniquely humorous lines and skits to make the movie a mostly novel laughable experience. So, kudos to the writers for those parts.

Negatives:
Studios with their crew of writers, directors and producers know that making money takes precedence over creativity so with that thought in mind we have the following too predictable scenes:
A stereotypic plot framework of a newly divorced couple with teens.
Teens have their own issues as well as navigating/mediating the divorce.
Dad, as usual, had his own father family issues growing up.
Dad is seen as more in love with his monied vocational interests than the kids.
Mom, has a new male friend that ends up to be a boor. Yes, gets booted.
At stake is a prize piece of property that is predictably going to be procured by Dad after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Dad also wins kids and wife after he re-prioritizes with the help of, guess who, penguins.
Penguins, at first, were presented in a clever way but towards the end the writers ran out of ideas and the animals just did the same made-up cute tricks found in most animal movies.

In summary, if the movie just had Pipi and the penguins to build around it would have had the potential to be creatively - spot on.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"Death of Klinghoffer may or may not be a good opera.  It may or may not inappropriately glorify the Palestinian cause.  But, from this production, we'll never know.
First, it is a film based on the opera, NOT a film of the opera.  Something like one-half of the running time is devoted to videos of imagined (on the part of the director) action while the opera score serves as mere soundtrack.  What this might have looked like on the stage is entirely lost.  Alice Goodman is a subtle poet -- I doubt that she intended her libretto to be illustrated by such ham-handed visuals as this film employs.
Second, and much worse, is the awful background noise that overlays much of the music.  We hear shouting, gunfire, rocks hitting walls, and so on, during much of the time the chorus is singing, and even sometimes when the principals are singing.  On occasion this background noise drowns out the opera itself.  It is absolutely infuriating -- one wants to hear John Adams' music, not Ms. Eurotrash's background chatter.  It looks like the director simply uses this score as throwaway background music for a political film.
This is one of the few opera DVDs that I would not recommend that anyone acquire.  And it's really too bad -- we need more DVD recordings of good modern operas such as those of Adams.",0

John Chatterton is a total man with his perfect code of ethics, his raw courage & experience, his class 'A' intelligence and heroic handsome features.  Richie Koehler originally hung with a band of bad boys and had a major problem at home, as well.  However, Chatterton knew and valued his abilities, raw courage and superb  knowledge, so he went to work to get him on the right side of history with himself.  John & Richie have created one of the richest stories of modern times; and, by doing it have solved one of the last persistent mysteries of WWII.

If you've seen this movie, you probably know what I'm talking about. There's one scene in which Nicholson REALLY doesn't want to invite his ditsy girlfriend (Karen Black) to come along to the family home to visit his dying father - and when he realizes he can't get out of it, he sits in his car and comes unglued. Then he get out, goes back inside and very calmly says, ""Rayette, you wanna come with me?""
The other one is in a roadside caf when the laconic waitress won't alter the menu selections by one jot - and again he comes unglued as only Nicholson can do when he's at the top of his performance, which he usually is.
But the rest of this movie is dark, dark, dark - a mood piece of a dysfunctional family. Nicholson plays a wounded outcast, a former piano prodigy who has been estranged from his father for years, spending his time as an oil worker in Texas, shacking up with his annoying girlfriend. When he learns his father is dying in Washington State, he sets off for 'home.' Most of the rest of the film is an odyssey, a road trip back to the family mansion and all he's left behind: his attachments, his family, his problems, his fears, and his failures.

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"I had high expectations of this miniseries, given it's creation under the auspices and consultancy of Mr. King himself.  It turned out to be a drawn out melodrama, full of gimmickry and with very little of the artistic panache of the original movie.  The hotel itself was attractive enough, but from there on, it went downhill.  Neither the malevolent, carnivorous topiaries in the garden, nor the two lame ghost plot participants did much to create a haunted atmosphere in the hotel.  The hotel's creaks and groans and auto-swinging doors were trite and none of the characters were truly convincing.  Rebecca de Mornay as Wendy is alright, Jack Torrance, played here by Steven Weber is an annoying exercise in waffling, being an aggressive boozer one minute, and a pathetic whimperer the next.  He never seems to be able to make up his mind who he is or what he wants,  an irritatingly disjointed character who himself seems to have no idea where he is going.  Consequently, the whole thing is ultimately a three hour bore. While the original movie may have had it's shortcomings in its abrupt structure of the progression of the story, it was nevertheless far more convincing than this mushy rendition which seemed to be nothing more than the product of the mercantile minds at Warner Brothers, doing their level best to wrest additional revenue from a classic story.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"I'm not a purist, I thought where LOTR deviated from the book it was done to good effect and often brought in material and character background from Tolkien's own notes.

The Hobbit movie does not have the same reverence for the source material.  Clearly the makers thought the book story was too boring for modern viewers so they turned it into an action-and-adventure movie with no subtlety or sense of discovery.  Orcs are brought in much earlier in the story to tack on fight scenes and drive the party (rather than boring old cold and hunger).  Computer animated scenes and cutesie additional characters are thrown in to market to kids.  The action in the stone giants scene is right out of Transformers and the orc dungeons are shown as vast Moria-like caverns to allow gratuitous animated tracking shots.

The beginning of the Gollum scene was the end of the movie for me.  Instead of Gollum creeping out of the gloom, he is introduced in a made-up action scene and the ring pops out of his pocket in a flash of animated effects so no one can miss it.

If I was a purist I'd give it one or two stars but if you take it as a standalone action movie and not an adaptation of a great book it's not bad.  So I'm giving it a 3.  Just don't expect the experience you had with LOTR.",0

David Kalat's extraordinary commentary is easily THE BEST I have ever heard (and I've heard quite a few.) He strikes the perfect balance between knowledge and wit - the narration is informative without being dry or condescending and, indeed, is quite lively at times. His delivery style is remarkably excellent throughout and is a major reason I consider the disk to be one of my most valued.
Two tiny quibbles, stuff so small as to bother only me: The English Language captioning, written for the German audio track, is a little disorienting when viewed in connection with the English language track. Most of this has to do with the demands of lip-synchronization between two languages. Still, and despite the additional cost it might have created, two independent sets of captions would have been appreciated - one for each of the different languages. This would be a welcome addition for a hearing impared viewer.
The other minor quibble is that the documentary really needed captioning, much more so than the feature owing to the heavy accented speech.

Shirley MacLaine's performance as the dancer-turned-mother and wifie, and Ann Bancroft's role as the aging ballerina who won't let go of the past is quite realistic. Each woman is struggling with an ego that won't allow them to voice their true emotions, all fear-based and poignant. One fears that she wasn't ever good enough to become the star her friend went on to be, and hides behind motherhood and a veiled jealousy of her daughter who is definitely on her way. The other is also jealous of the life her friend has, and fears growing old and being forgotten by the dance world she loves and hates. As Shirley MacLaine's character seeks answers through infidelity and anger, Ann Bancroft takes Shirley's daughter hostage, pets and spoils her - all to feed her own self-confidence.  Frankly, I think the cat fight on the roof is a wonderful scene, because finally, the two friends are able to show her fear and anger of being forgotten and growing old, and express their desire for something they can never have, for whatever reason, to each other.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

Joan Collins is head of a group pushing an island paradise resort - yet to be built - and Lancing is the pilot of the boat that brings in the latest boatload of suckers....I mean investors...to view the imaginary golf course and club house.  Only problem, refugees from THEM! are lurking in the woods making off with islanders and soon to investors of Joan's resort.  The effects are typical Drive-in B movie quality (but hey, I miss the old drive-ins!! When I visited Kentucky they would have dusk to dawn creature features and that is where I first saw this movie), but Lancing as always is better than the material he is given and makes this worth the ticket.
So stack up four of five our your best Vincent Price and Chris Lee films, add Empire of the Ants (and watch the wonderful and well missed Robert Lancing), pop a bowl of popcorn , turn out the lights and imagine you are in a car with a speaker hanging from the window.  Have your own dusk to dawn creature features.

He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before he rethinks his life and career. With a new look at life he heads to New Jersey to find the son he never knew and start writing again. As many of you know by now I am a huge Pacino fan. I think he is the greatest actor working today but some of his recent movies I haven't been a big fan of. He was great in The Humbling but I thought the movie was a little slow. This is a role that seemed like a stretch for him (he does his own singing) but because he is so great he pulls it off and it seems like a role he was made for. The movie is very fun and easy to watch. The cast is great and the writing is funny and heartfelt. Only an actor like Pacino can turn a clichd cheesy line like some dinners are worth fighting for into something that is meaningful. Overall, I am a little biased because Pacino is my favorite actor but this is a great movie and his best movie in a few years. I give it an A.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Money. What everyone wants. And when they get it, all they want is more. That is the basic concept behind Confidence. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a con man that makes his living by scamming people out of their money. Accompanied by his three buddies (Louis Lombardi, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Van Holt), the crew moves from city to city tricking people and stealing their money. But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is. There are numerous amounts of heist and con movies around right now, but this film tells the way people feel about money very well, while still keeping your eyes glued to the screen.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"What a wonderful movie this is! The triumph of form over content portrayed with icy precision. Characters acknowledge each other  mostly in terms of self-absorbed one-upsmanship. Surface and ritual reign supreme, indeed characters confuse each other's identities with neither thought nor consequence. Sex, for Patrick Bateman (as probably for all others) is  an expression of vanity and power, nothing more. Patrick Bateman's only moments of true passion and fulfillment occur when he kills. Irony and paradox: does he kill so as to feel alive and vibrant, or does he kill precisely to feed his need to suppress feeling, like an alcoholic drinks to suppress his need for alcohol. Feelings, after all, are messy, not very elegant.  Irony itself conveys a measure of elegance. Thus the movie comments on itself. AmPsy is not really satire. There is no real madness or wackiness here, nor does it carry that element of pratfall, grotesquerie, reality turned inside out to affirm itself, which underly satiric points. It's a disquisition on a decade, a perspective, a way of being that is still very much part of us today. Perhaps now we do it a bit more vulgarly.  There is keen pleasure in realizing that the camera itself, more than words, is the scalpel for the irony which defines this chilly tale. I bet the screenplay is relatively short. Don't miss this film. It's also very funny. You just have to meet Patrick Bateman, a really swell guy.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"I had fun watching ""Bad Teacher."" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.

A modern woman from contemporary New York City still living with her father ends up on an adventure beyond her imagining when a gateway between her world and the strange and surreal world of the 9 kingdoms is opened. The 9 kingdoms is an alternate reality where the fairy tales are strangely true and wolves (werewolves actually) do seduce young women, princes are put under wicked spells and dark, deep secrets are hidden behind the villainous wicked queen. (I won't spoil it for you.)

One character I love in particular in this is the neurotic Wolf. Wolf is a half-wolf (werewolf) and apparently a descendant of The Big Bad Wolf. Wolf becomes the love interest in the story.

There are some amazing acting talents in this mini-series including Diane Weist in her very first villain role. It's shocking to see her out of the sugary sweet motherly role we're used to such as her role as Peg in Edward Scissorhands and the mother role in Lost Boys.

Another thing I like is the beautiful yet full figured woman who played Snow White- the actress from the practice. The writers paid close attention to detail in remembering that the original Snow White story's protagonist was fair and plump and they didn't follow the modern trend of the sickly-thin conception of beauty.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Censorship and moral codes took the bite out of screwball comedy as the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such directors as Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found ways to revive the genre in very high style.  Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed.
There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE does not give up all her secrets in one whack.

Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?

The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...

He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, ""hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry""; classic stuff.

Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton's character(Julien Grendel).

I wasn't particularly interested in ""Office Space"" when it first came out, and I assume that it was a sleeper hit upon theatrical release, but when I checked it out much later, I was on the floor laughing. Not only does ""Office Space"" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.

Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but ""Office Space"" is a grand exception. Ron Livingston is perfect in the role of Peter, who learns that by doing nothing you can find the ultimate happiness and confidence you seek (thanks to unreversed hypnosis). Gary Cole's portrayal of the boring yet frightening Lumbergh should be added to the pantheon of best screen villains ever, and Stephen Root was simply born to play Milton.

If you're a Miranda fan, you'll enjoy this FOX TECHNICOLOR MUSICAL. Michael O'SHEA looks a little too old and his uniform is a few sizes too small...to bad they didn't cast PERRY COMO in this leading role. Also O'SHEA is not the best singer either...most all other cast members do a great job...EXCEPT...PHIL SILVERS who is loud and ANNOYING!
Carmen has two colorful production numbers, the first, typical Miranda, the second and last is Carmen in a totally different appearance THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, a different 'short'costume than usual showing more leg...the lighting in this number is somewhat over the top...however, looks great in this pristine transfer. Only problem I had is in the EXTRA FEATURES: The ""STILL GALLERY"" feature in my copy doesn't allow my access to it...used two different DVD players and both had the same problem. The Film, Scenes, Trailer, and the SUPERB DOCUMENTARY are no problem. The documentary is in four parts...great interviews, vintage still photos and live performances, both candids and her FOX production numbers make this one of the best Documentaries out there...the Documentary is worth the price of this DVD ALONE!

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Most Anime's that come out have clean, well-defined lines as well as neat sharp colors.  This is the common style not only for mass consumption but for ease of the work load by standardization.  While Casshern of course has its roots burried deep in all that makes Anime look like Anime, it's one of very few that have ventured beyond for a more artistic delivery.  At times there are some very sketchy lines, contorted facial features, rapid action that instead of a subdued unmoving backgrounds, every part of many frames are animated to keep the eyes fairly treated.  Casshern is a great story, one that in the first half is nearly perfect, if only the second half could have carried it as gracefully.  Still, the second half isn't one to scoff at, as it's still great and brings with it the finality of the characters that over the course of the show you come to enjoy, even Ringo.  What makes this show great is that it isn't teathered to its source material, and instead of being a tribute, it's a reboot.  This isn't only one of the better animated shows ever produced, but a great story as well.  One that isn't necessarily just for fans of Anime, but people that can appreciate the medium.

This movie was made with the same rationale and in the same spirit as spaghetti westerns, which fared a whole lot better, but riding on the success of Mad Max and Escape from New York. You have to LOVE a movie which manages to throw in every conceivable creature in a single feature, -for the sake of maximizing whatever little resources available and also save the audience time and money watching them in separate entries-, even ninjas, ex-soft core stars, fishmen, apemen, telepaths, killer blind monks, werewolves, etc... and manages to anticipate the idea behind such movies as The Running Man, while attempting to be something else. This is a movie in its very own league, not to be judged by any other standards; actually Joe D'Amato's favorite among all the colorful entries in his immense catalogue. I reckon from seeing Death Smiles on a Murderer, that David Lynch's place in film history should have been occupied by him instead, but there was just no market for such a thing in the Italian industry back then. So, he went, ""if they want rubbish,  I have no problem delivering just that.."" and the rest is history.

They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away!
So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best.

Then again not many action movies will change your view on life.

Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good.

This is evident by his Peckinpah-esque story arc and settings and his pair of anti-heroes; the John Woo-esque excessive gunplay, the subsequent and frequent showers of bullets, and the limitless supply of people to kill, and guns to kill them with; and the Quentin Tarantino-esque self-conscious subversion of the genre.  I didn't mind all his overt nods/homages/rip-offs (whatever) because it still made for a heady mix that was fun, albeit a little too violent for my tastes.  Even the slow, slow-speed car chase, the failed-but-then-successful kidnapping attempt, and the cell-phone bit were fun although it's clear that McQuarrie is too conscious of the trademarks/cliches set down by his predecessors and is trying his darnedest to put a fresh spin on things.  But what weren't fun for me were the complex turns the plot took about halfway through the film.  Last week, I saw another overplotted film, ""Nurse Betty"", and I forgave the turns in that plot because LaBute dutifully made sure each of them paid off (although not all of them worked).  Here, the complications get piled on top of one another for no reason, and some are left to dangle without ever being resolved or even referred to again.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"During the seventies, german director Werner Herzog has given us three movies - AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD, KASPAR HAUSER and HEART OF GLASS - which stay as unique pearls in Movie History. This director is a visionary,  one of the rare authors who have been able to create a cinematic world out  of their dreams. Just watch and listen to the featurette (Thank you, Anchor  Bay): this guy is an authentic genius coming from the same family of the  Saints of the Middle Ages or the most famous composers.
NOSFERATU, shot  in 1978, tries to establish a link between the german directors of the  1918-1926 period, Fritz Lang or Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau for instance,  authors who reigned over international cinema at that time and the new  generation of german directors that appeared in the late sixties with such  remarkable individuals as Rainer-Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders or Werner  Herzog.
Werner Herzog is also the last of the XIXth german romantics with  his images haunted by nostalgy, with his heroes able to see what is  invisible to common people. You have to enter into NOSFERATU as if you're  about to dream. If not, you'll surely be bored after 5 minutes. But if you  find in yourself the courage to follow Werner Herzog, you will experiment  something you'll never forget.
Other Werner Herzog's movies will be  released in the DVD standard very soon, so be prepared to dream.

I highly recommend this series for anyone who has not seen it before. It was an interesting movie, not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The story is very well told and the action scenes are just right for a comedy movie. Good movie, great story line, good characters. This is a very good movie. I like this movie.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The subject is the so-called Judgment of Paris--the blind tasting in which California wines defeated French wines and shocked the world.  The film tells part of the story: the efforts of the individual--Steve Spurrier--who mounted the event and the Barrett family in Calistoga, the proprietors of Chateau Montelena.  To add drama and conflict the film adds a father-son set-to among the Barretts and a love triangle with the younger Barrett, a female intern at the winery and a Latino employee, who would go on to run his own winery.

Chateau Montelena won with its Chardonnay, but nothing is said (until the film's end) about Stag's Leap's victory in the Cabernet competition.  Similarly, nothing is said about Chateau Montelena's winemaker, Mike Grgich, a then limited partner whose great 1973 Chardonnay enabled him to form a partnership with Austin Hills to form Grgich Hills, which is still known for the quality of its Chardonnay, while Chateau Montelena is now known as well for its superb Cabernet.

Bottom line: this is a slightly schmaltzy take on a historically-significant subject, but one that still works cinematically.  The wine country offers fantastic views, of course, and the Montelena scenes are shot at its stunning facility--a castle carved out of the side of the earth, forming, in effect, a man-made cave in Calistoga.

The DVD includes interviews with the Barretts and a brief account of the winery and its standards and aspirations.  All in all, this is a nice film.  I also recommend the often-overlooked film, Year of the Comet, for wine lovers.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"A dozen years ago, this Arnold Schwarzenegger action flick was fairly hot stuff but I wonder if it would have the impact today since special effects continue to be so much better and we've seen so many of these type of action stories in the past 12 years?

One of Arnold's keys to his successful career in films was simply that his movies were entertaining, and that's why people come to the theaters. High-brow national critics often forget that. ""Eraser"" is a prime example. Entertainment alone is how this particular movie survives since common logic doesn't exist here and violence and profanity are overdone. But, despite it's low-brow tastes and stupidity, it's still generally fun to watch if you can put your brain on hold for two hours. It's also fun to hear, too, if you have a nice surround system.

This movie has one of the most outrageous action scenes I've ever seen on film, even to this day: one in which Arnold hangs from the outside of a jet airplane, finally lets go, free-falls to catch his parachute that had been ripped off, and then has to worry about the jet plane which had circled around and was going to smash him!!

The audio came into play nicely each time the super rifle that was featured in the movie was shot. Vanessa Williams plays the female lead satisfactorily and James Caan is very effective as the villain. Robert Pastorelli and James Coburn also add to the fun. A few laughs along the way help this no-brainer to become even more entertaining.",0

Having gone through her ordeal with her (and thus being labeled a ""caretaker""...who really took care of whom?, is my question) I sat down and watched these DVDs with her.  This is a very entertaining series!  Bravo, ShowTime, for creating a great show!  However, this woman has problems.  She's in denial, she wants no one to help her, she doesn't want other people to know about her condition...the exact opposite of what my wife endured.  My wife let EVERYBODY know that she had cancer, and as a result friends and family came rushing to her aid; her support group meant everything to her and made her ordeal that much easier to handle.  Three years later she's not only a survivor, and meaner than ever at that (I'm proud to say that I'm back to getting my much deserved weekly beatings), but she's an advocate for other cancer patients who do not have the friends and family to support them in their time of need.  Perhaps the moral of this series is that no one can suffer the disease alone...everyone needs a support group...and by denying her condition to herself and others she's doing herself a disservice.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef was the second or third Cinemascope movie. Cinemascope format was like IMAX format turned on its side - it was wide, rather than tall. Cinemascope movies were in color, and most movies were not in color in 1953. Scenes were typically breathtaking; actors were beautiful or handsome as appropriate. With all that, plot and acting were frequently deficient. BTTMR has more or less adequate acting, its scenes were originally beautiful, and its actors appealed to audiences of the day. That was enough to get it by.

The movie fell into the public domain a while back. Many grainy copies emerged. Also, televisions could not adequately frame the Cinemascope format, so copies were abbreviated laterally. As a result, all the elements that originally sold this movie were neutralized. The version I purchased on Amazon VOD was unforgivably poor, and of course the deficient plot remains. Indeed, the writing is less forgivable than the appearance.

At some point, it seemed to me that I had been watching this turkey for an awfully long time so I checked to see how much more I had to endure. The ROKU told me four minutes. Hmmm. Four minutes. Problem was the movie still had a half dozen plot lines unresolved. I continued the movie.

In four minutes, the bad guys showed up, there was a fight, then everybody kissed and made up, the meanest bad guy happily gave his girl to the youngest good guy, and the credits rolled. Four minutes. (Did I mention?)

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"And with no further adieu, here is what I think about Captain Phillips.

We have a movie that is based on real events, hence being introduced to the titular character Richard(""Rich"" in the movie). Richard Phillips is given the task of taking command of a ship by the name MV Maersk Alabama. And as he aboards the ship things are running ever so smoothly. However, after taking notice of two not-so-familiar boats that are approaching the ship, our Captain finds himself at the very center of a hostage crisis, and from there, we have our movie.

I should start by saying that I did do some research going into the movie; and although there have been reports that this movie itself is not entirely accurate, I loved Captain Phillips. Tom Hanks has had numerous good/great performances; THIS IS one of his greats. From beginning to end, he personifies the role of the Captain turned hostage very well. And though Barkhad Abdi is relatively an unknown actor, he was equally as great in his role as Abduwali Muse. Great acting.

The situation on screen is almost unbearable; many times during the movie I was holding my breath because of the intensity of the scenes and the savagery of the Somalian pirates. They are not clever, but they have guns, and their leader Abduwali has a motive.

If you have not yet seen Captain Phillips, I urge everyone to give this movie a watch. With Outstanding performances and a notably shrill 3rd act, Captain Phillips gets

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.

Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.

The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!

What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.

What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does.",0

This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.

Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.

The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.

All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.

Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!

Like on RAH, the guests were a total distraction.  Unlike some reviewers here, I really do not care for Ms Hart's vocal stylings.  My negative reaction to her is nearly as strong as my deep disappointment with Glenn Hughes & the BCC sound.  Hiatt and Rodgers were like the guests on RAH - old greats that just don't hold a candle anymore to the stratospheric Mr Bonamassa.

Fortunately, it's a nice full program and so you can skip past the guests and still feel like you got your money's worth.  Joe and the boys are really very good - worthy of the many 5 star reviews here.  Bergman is the only lineup change from the group I saw perform live - and a fine addition.  I especially liked Blue and Evil, since that was the highlight for me on Black Rock.  I was delighted that Joe dug into the old catalogue and pulled out The River, because I missed him playing that one when I saw him.

But that tees up my recommendation.  RAH is better than this for the musical selections but the DVD you should really get is the old Rockpalast one.  Joe really shines in that more intimate club setting and you can see why he deserved the recognition that enabled him to move on and play the grande venues.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I have a soft spot for GOG because I saw it when I was very young with my parents at a Drive In (not first run, but in some late-1960s re-release).

This is, honestly, NOT some long forgotten great SF treasure. This is not War Of The Worlds, or Time Machine, or Day The Earth Stood Still, or The Thing, or Invasion Of The Body Snatchers-- great films all.

GOG is a second- or even third-rate SF B-picture. It's almost one step away from being a MST3K parody. ( I haven't checked, maybe MST3K actually did parody it).

There's a lot of talk and not much action. The characters are all cardboard. The scriptwriters force the actors to deliver looooooong monolog lectures, 'explaining' nonexistent pseudo-science to an audience they must have thought were imbeciles. The dialog is stilted and chunky and amateurish.

And the zero-budget 'special effects' are GOG and MAGOG, a couple of aluminum-foil-covered-cardboard-box chest-height ""robots"" that don't even move an inch for most of their brief time onscreen.

I mean, this is a painfully awful little film.

I would never spend money to own a copy. But if you're in a nostalgic (and very forgiving, and MST3K-ish) mood, by all means see this on Instant Prime Streaming.
Feel free to jeer and boo at times, and enjoy the cheesy no-budget unintended campiness that is GOG.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.

With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.

Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.

I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"If you don't recoil from the idea of a school teacher in charge of your children's education who smokes dope, lies, steals, manipulates those around her, uses movies to babysit her class while she sleeps off a hangover every morning and is totally devoid of any sense of professional responsibility to her students, then maybe you'll find this film funny.

The overriding conceit at the heart of `Bad Teacher' is the idea that the audience will somehow look past the reprehensible moral bankruptcy at the core of the central character (played to perfection by Cameron Diaz) and root for her, because she's good looking and has a few memorable one-liners so all can be forgiven. The character Diaz plays so well is dishonest, greedy, lazy, irresponsible, rude, utterly self-serving and in every way despicable. She is educating your kids, folks, and her manipulative, blackmailing ways win out for her in the end. This is funny, OK?

The film gets two stars rather than one because, on a purely technical level, it works as a (very improbable) narrative. The storyline is coherent and the editing snappy, the actors give their all, the script does have its moments, it's watchable. But somehow it's hard to get past the overall message the film leaves you with: if you're a selfish, lying, morally bankrupt, pot-smoking, drunken, money-grubbing whore willing to blackmail and deceive all around you whilst having complete contempt for any kind of professional responsibility to your students and their futures, this is in some way admirable. You will win out over more honest and responsible people, and it's hilarious.

I had to get up at the end of the film to watch it again.  It was still very enjoyable.  The story is very well done and the characters are very believable.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Why do I love this show?

I want every character on this show to be my best friend (except Robin).  They're funny, caring, and awesome.  The actors truly have tons of chemistry, providing a quality show in a half-hour block.

This is no generic sitcom.  Sure, it's got a laugh track and some of the banter is clich&eacute;, however, most of it is incredibly witty and heartfelt.  Ted is engaged in a genuine search for love, and I'm completely wrapped up in it.  I fell in love with the Cake Girl (Victoria, played by Ashley Williams) and was sad to see her go (it's probably why I'm not a huge fan of Robin).  This show has continuity and a compelling storyline; it simply amazes me.

It's very quotable.  I find myself quoting with friends I've talked into watching it (who get equally hooked).  The cast is brilliant, as well as the director and writers.  Bloc Party's song: `This Modern Love' at the close of Season One clenched it for me though, dramatically building up a powerful finale I won't soon forget.  It joins the hall of fame for greatest season finale songs with the likes of The O.C's: Imogen Heap `Hide and Seek' and Grey's Anatomy's: Snow Patrol `Chasing Cars'.

Hands down, this is the best sitcom I've ever seen.  Buy it, watch it, love it.

DISCLAIMER: Though the writers are good at what they do, don't listen to any of their commentaries.  They are exceptionally boring, lackluster, and have slightly soured my enjoyment of the show.  It's that bad.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The movie's time frame, setting and plot are all similar to Command Decision, another fine wartime drama about air combat. But this one features a different cast and much more action. Gregory Peck plays Brigadier Gen. Frank Savage, who is given a critical task. In 1942 in England, early in World War II, he must restore the effectiveness and morale of the men of the 918th bomber group while replacing their beloved commander, Gen. Keith Davenport (Gary Merrill). The way he does so is tremendously difficult for both him and his men, but given what's at stake - possibly the outcome of the war - you can see that he has no choice. This movie was cited most often by members of the U.S. 8th Air Force as the most accurate representation of their lives and missions dramatized on film. Written by Beirne Lay, Jr. and Sy Bartlett from their novel, it is an intelligent, highly thoughtful portrayal of the stresses of command in wartime, and it's a tribute to the quiet but amazing heroism of the men who flew bombing missions against Germany. The 12-minute combat sequence featuring B-17 bombers against Messerschmitt and Focke-Wulf fighters is incredibly harrowing and more realistic than anything else on film - because it is real battle footage. Dean Jagger won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Peck's top aide, and Peck himself is terrific, as are Millard Mitchell as the Air Force commander in England, and Hugh Marlowe (in possibly his best role) as a trouble-plagued pilot.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phil-s-Favorite-500-Loves-of-a-Moviegoing-Lifetime-2014-edition/dp/B00HU8VK4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)</a>",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.

The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.

This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II"".",0
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I'm going to review this movie for 1 reason only, and it's for the HDR (4k release) content. My opinion on the movie itself is too subjective, and some people just hate Zach Snyder so they won't watch this movie anyways. Anyhow, let's talk about the HDR, and you're buying this for the upgraded visuals. Let me tell you something, the last half of the movie is SIMPLY STUNNING and if you have a newer 4k television with the ability to handle HDR correctly, you'll be in for a visual treat. This is the movie you show to people that have not seen 4k and HDR before, because the colors and contrast pops so much it's stunning. You're literally going to be amazed how bright some objects in the scenes look. Zach Snyder is known for loving his darker scenes, and this movie is very dark in tone and in plot, but then he amazes us with a visual treat when the action  picks up and that dark mood is met with explosions, bright glowing kryptonite, and heat vision eye blasts. If there was a way to capture the image to prove this to you, I would do so and upload it. For now, you need the right type of UHD HDTV that is calibrated and can handle HDR content, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The movies for 4k with HDR are lacking right now, and you want to show off? Pick up this title, because even if you aren't a fan of the plot, you WILL be a fan of showing this off to others.",0

There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. ""  Does that count?). Gloria Swanson plays Nella Vago, a young singer who has a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lacks warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella returns home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera has refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she goes to the apartment of the young man and makes love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. ""  But now she has to choose between a career and the man she loves (apparently having both does not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gowns by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy was based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed less like a play.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I always thought of Night Gallery as the second generation of Twilight Zone. This show is pretty similar to Twilight Zone in that it mixes the supernatural with Sci-Fi and suspense. Rod Serling had supposedly starting planning Night Gallery as early as 1964 when TZ was cancelled. Is Night Gallery as great as TZ? No, but it's a great ""second coming"" if you will. Night Gallery opens with Rod Serling describing each story with its own unique painting, which usually has to do with  something in the episode.

Season 1 is relatively short, containing only 6 50-minute episodes. The picture quality leaves a bit to be desired, as the picture is a bit scratched in some parts and colors seem a bit weak sometimes. The audio is relatively quiet so just turn your TV volume up nice and loud for this set. The Universal logo appears before each episode and it BLARES in comparison to the show's low volume.

The only sort of ""bonus features"" are some bonus stories. I'm not sure if these were unaired or just taken from other seasons, but they they're on disc 3 after the 6th and final episode of the season. Also included on Disc 1 is the original 1 and 1/2 hour Pilot film filmed in 1969.

Overall, the episodes appear complete though the quality isn't exactly as great as it could have been. Is the set worth 20-some dollars? I'd say not. I'd say its worth more along the lines of $10-15 as you don't get very many episodes. Nevertheless, I'd DEFINITELY add this to my collection for Night Gallery being the great show it is.",0

There is no ""time paradox,"" unless you count its inception, which I still haven't figured out solidly.  Its well-acted and skillfully laid out so that many of the bigger, more radical plot jumps are easier to buy into.

Still, it's a contrivance that's essential to the plot, but revealed carefully and orderly so you can focus on the characters and how things play out (unless you're hyper-sensitive about normalcy).  If you're attentive, as you figure out the first few twists, you'll find the later twists easy to predict.  But I still haven't figured out two points: 1. The prime mover of the cycle of events  2. the motive for the agency causing what they cause  3. how the agency first caused what they cause.  (Okay, that's three, but they overlap.)

When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone.
Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome.
The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo.
The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive.

It is definitely for film lovers who like something far out of the ordinary. Set in war-time Japan, this story of a doctor literally on the run in his efforts to unravel the mystery of an epidemic of hepatitis among his patients, could be taking place anywhere in this war-torn world today. Resources are in short supply, and everywhere there is violence and fear triggered by the embrace of militarism. The doctor, a heroic figure, is surrounded in this film by the outcasts of society - a prostitute, an opium addict, an escaped prisoner of war. Cheered by recognition from his colleagues in the medical profession that his work is valued and important, he is left with little to make a difference in the world, except his determination to do the best he can.

The sudden shifts of mood in the film, the use of a noisy jazz score, the outbursts of violence, scenes of sexual tension, the heartfelt moments as characters reach out with tenderness to each other, all provide a jumble of conflicting impressions that reflect the chaotic world it mirrors. There's not a single point of view in the film though it ends emphatically with the detonation of an atomic bomb on the horizon, as the doctor and his assistant float in an open boat in the sea (an image that brings to mind the end of Ingmar Bergman's ""Shame"").

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"Review of Secondhand Lions
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.

Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good.",0

A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;).",0

The only thing this series succeeds in is putting a whole new meaning in the phrase ""love hurts."" Most of it involves Keitaro getting into embarrassing incidents with these women and getting the crap kicked out him. This happens in just about EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' EPISODE. It gets old in no time and is just discouraging to me as a viewer. Worse still, there's nary a sympathetic character, much less one the audience REALLY cares about. I practically detested the female characters, especially Keitaro's intended sweetheart, the nasty, overly violent Naru, who comes across as one of the most intolerable, bitchiest, bad-tempered heroines ever committed to Anime. (Yes, she's as bad as the title character from NADIA: THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER in the infamous island/Africa arc and Asuka in EVANGELION.) There are occasional bits of cleverness (like a parody of the popular JRPG DRAGON QUEST), but LOVE HINA's overall nature is too mean-spirited for its own entertainment value. Even if the idea was to make this a comedy, it still falls flat. You'd have to be a masochist in order to sit through this joyless show. Matters are not helped by the dubbing, with performances that range from shrill to just plain awful, a disappointing misfire from the usually capable Bang Zoom studios. All in all, I absolutely detested LOVE HINA and I cannot recommend it. There are far better Anime shows to invest in.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!

Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.

Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)

I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.

That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.

Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing.",0

While the two have had a lot of fun together, the beginning of the movie is pretty much a family affair. It's a little more serious than some of the other Disney movies, but still a fun ride. The most memorable scene is when the kids are at school and the teacher tells them that there's nothing to do if they go to the library. They're not even allowed to go to the library. The teacher tells them that they can't go to the library if they're not allowed to go. So, they go to the library. The movie is a little too serious and the movie isn't at all realistic.

We became our own T.V. station!

We stopped paying the cable company hundreds and hundreds of dollars for programming we don't like (because complaining about modern television is about as helpful as peeing up hill) and we channeled that money into DVD/Blu Ray purchases of shows we know we love and this one was one the list!

Green Acres is the story of a New York lawyer who has always dreamed of owning/operating a farm - a true pioneer in the 'Back to the Land' movement (John Denver would have been proud).

When Mr. Douglas seems too starry eyed and naive to notice his high society wife is only too happy to point out the problems.  What happens next is anyone's guess in this zany half hour comedy which we can't seem to stop watching  (even our teen daughter).

This is merely a limited animation rendering of the artwork with music and voice acting.  In this case it's pretty well done and I personally think they are getting better as they go on.

This one is a lot more ambitious then the prior installments in terms of action.  I originally thought this would be another Wolverine story but it does a good job at show casing a range of characters.  I enjoyed the Terminator by way of super heroes plus some Robocop for good measure story even if Jason Aaron can be hit or miss with me.  The voice acting is improving as well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond as a pretty good Wolverine.  Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

It was cool to see a rather under used character like Deathlok get show cased.  I hope Marvel Knights starts to move more in this direction as they continue.  Also surprised they couldn't interview Aaron for this.  Made the special feature seem less interesting.

Another complaint is I didn't think it was made clear that the Deathlok internalizing is supposed to be the same one every time.  With that little bit of spoiler free information the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  They still don't explain him that well though or why he has Wolverine claws and an Ironman hand.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Most T.V. viewers already know the Bob Newhart show from the number of times it's been syndicated. If you haven't seen it recently, now is the time to give it another look and see comedy which was driven by good writing rather than by overused and/or hackneyed sitcom plots. It's also a pleasure to see humor which isn't nasty or negative. The Bob Newhart show is downright ""fresh"" when viewed alongside current comedy fare.

As for the complaints about the packaging and lack of extras, one has to consider the *extremely* low price for the season and the experience Fox had with the Mary Tyler Moore show (another classic of the same era). Fox gave the first season of the Mary Tyler Moore show the star treatment and a higher price to cover the cost and it sold poorly. This made them reluctant to even release other classic comedies and the Bob Newhart show may never have seen a DVD release.

While I would have liked to have seen an interview with Bob offering some memories of  his experience with the show (or introductions), I think this type of comedy doesn't benefit much from commentary since the humor is in the pacing and the dialog. Talking over the show would seem rather disruptive and pointless. Also, I'm not sure how much anyone could remember from a show that aired so long ago.

Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I prefer realism over Hollywood story telling.  This film is a great ""Popcorn"" type of War Movie, that in a way reminds me of the old 40's war movies.  The plot centers around a tank crew led by Brad Pitt's character ""WarDaddy""  (right away, when I see a War film with the characters all having nicknames, I know I am in for less than realism and more Hollywoodism).

There's a lot to like about this film.  It is entertaining, the sound effects are awesome (LOVE LOVE LOVE the .50 cal firing), there's suspense, tension, and afront to innocence brought into a combat scenario.

The tactics, movement, command and control structure, and even discipline are all Hollywood screen writers (by that I mean, they are not realistic, but written for the screen to be entertaining).  The combat is intense, although a bit too contrived.  I think actual combat would've seen the engagements they depict not turn out as depicted.

Still, I feel this film is worthy of 4 stars (the only reason I didn't go 5 is because of the realism factor)... I don't feel at all like I wasted my money.

I haven't addressed a story synopsis or plot lines because, to be quite honest, I don't want to spoil your viewing (if you've not seen it), and if you have, you know those speak for themselves.

I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a really really good war film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Just don't expect the same level of immersion as other films, such as Platoon, or Saving Pvt. Ryan...  I don't think that was the filmakers' aim in making this.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"Reykjavik, Iceland Film Festival, September, 2000.
I was not sure what to expect from this. I am a longtime fan and student of all things Yugoslavian. I had seen Makavejev's comparatively commercial film A Night of Love prior to screening two of his more obscure films, Sweet Movie, which is nothing less than visually frightening and decidedly disturbing, and this, Mysteries of an Organism. With more disturbing visual imagery and borrowings from surreal fantasy, the second half of the film is more like a ""film"" in that it tells a story of a Yugoslav woman, who, like all women portrayed in the film, is very sexually liberated, and claims that this is so because all women have been justly liberated by the revolution and socialism in Yugoslavia. When she meets a visiting Russian figure skater, she realizes that the Soviet ideals of socialism are limiting and lead only to repression of the self. She tries to teach him that love and socialism are not at odds with each other, but are indeed intertwined. When they finally make love, he ends up killing her because his passions and love have been so repressed. The first half of the film, which is a bit excessive and strange, is more documentary in style, but it does illustrate the points that are made more eloquently in the second half of the film by probing the life of a man (whose name i cannot recall) who was demonised by the US government.
The screening in Reykjavik was luckily accompanied by the director himself explaining his ideas and what he hoped to accomplish. This is a fascinating film, a total departure from American, or really, any other films of any genre or nationality.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"Only a portion of this film is devoted to the actual rendition of the Water Music, and only a bit of the portion at that. The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat. Interesting and worth a watch, but not a huge thrill.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I know:  many viewers resented the apparent lack of physical chemistry between the characters played by Connery and Zeta-Jones.  Most of them had vivid memories of Sean Connery playing the always charismatic 007, and  Catherine Zeta-Jones exchanging sparks with Antonio Banderas in The Mask of  Zorro. But is chemistry between a man and a woman just, physical, sensual,  and sexual ?  I find the movie entertaining, as it shows 2 people  enjoying doing what they like best - no, I am not saying you should do the  same thing ! - but as it happens in life, people perform so much better  when they really like what they do.  The chemistry is between Zeta-Jones  youth, outgoing passion for life and Connery's less evident, more inward  quest for adventure which is backed up by his wisdom and longtime  experience.  As they go about doing and accomplishing things together, the  old man develops respect and acknowledges the younger woman's worth.  Slowly he starts to like her and, despite his age, or, perhaps because of  his age, he feels that, to a certain extent he cares for her.  While, at  the same time, she turns from intellectually admiring him to actually  liking him on her side. Admittedly, it is an uneasy chemistry between  Connery, the Scott gentleman and Catherine, the Welsh with long brown hair  and eyes, but the film offers enjoyable action moments interspersed with  occasionally good dialogue and exchanges between the two leads.

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I really can't suggest anything that would make this film better.  The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.  Each character is well defined and believable. I especially liked Dennis Farina's parody of the tough-talking Mafia boss (""Shut up or I'll shove this pencil through your heart!""), and his two flunkies (Moron #1 and Moron #2). The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor--the best kind of humor, situational.  There is even a tender awkward moment (when Jack, DeNiro, visits his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years, and she offers to give him her babysitting money, which he feels he shouldn't take, although he needs it).  The action is non-stop, and if you have to suspend your disbelief at times, it is a small price to pay.

The evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture. It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great. There are so many great scenes: when DeNiro and Grodin are eating dinner on the train, when they pretend to be from the Treasury Department in order to relieve a bartender of his ""counterfeit"" 20 dollar bills, the scene in the diner when Grodin, really hungry and broke, asks what's the special today, and the waitress says chorizo and eggs (dig the look on Grodin's face). DeNiro says they can't afford it, and Grodin counters ""How about your cigarettes?"", and DeNiro says, ""I need these.""  The film is chock full of these delicious scenes--I really can't think of a dull one.

This film is forever.  Buy it and see for yourself.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This is a charming movie with a great soundtrack and superb acting by Mel Gibson and Marisa Tomei.  Gibson reaches a peak of comedic genius in the movie, playing funny and compassionate moments with equal skill.  Although the movie's premise is rather absurd--a man who can hear women's thoughts after accidentally electrocuting himself in the bathroom--the viewer suspends disbelief and is drawn into the plot.  Marisa Tomei is hilarious as the ditzy coffee shop girl.  Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine, as well as Bette Midler, all have minor roles and are great in them.  Mark Feuerstein as Gibson's buddy is also excellent.  Some of the funny lines get a laugh from me every single time I watch (e.g., ""The poodle give you that one?"").  I loved the music, which included songs by Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Cole Porter, and more.  This is a romantic comedy, and although I find it hard to see Helen Hunt as a vulnerable, romantic leading lady--I think of her more as the sardonic character in ""Mad About You""--I thought she acted well in the movie and even worked in some ""cupcake""-type moves.  This is a DVD whose extra features are worth watching, particularly director Nancy Meyers' comments on how the movie was made.  This movie is a keeper that marries the modern dilemmas of romance with the feel of romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s.  Mel Gibson's dance scene and the scene where he waxes his leg are outstanding, and he is entirely believable as the chauvinistic playboy who is shocked at what women think.

What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over.",0

The movie's basic premise is that Jan Michael lives in a blue collar town that's completely out of control. He goes and get's a guy to come be a deputy and clean up the town. Only,, the guy turns out to be just as evil as the guys he's cleaning up. Hence, they might need a vigilante force.

Everyone in the movie is good. Kristofferson is great as always. He's a likable villain who charms his way into his position to take over the town.

In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.

I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.

It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I reviewed this movie after seeing it in theaters and gave it 3 1/2 stars. It has grown on me after seeing it a second time. I think it is on par with the first film, but the FF movie series suffers from too much comedy! I like comic book films to be fun but, it took away the drama in this movie and our heroes seemed to be in no danger. When the Thing gets hurled into Mr. Fantastic and they are imbedded in a wall the Thing's states ""That Smarts""! and peels Reed off the wall like a cartoon!

Although funny, too much of this just made it seem like a parody. The Thing's rocky exterior looks much better this time around and so are the effects. The Silver Surfer is a welcomed addition to the franchise and his FX are done extremely well! I know a lot of people were disappointed in Galactus being presented as a cloud but, I think an armor clad giant with a purple helmet would look ridiculous floating though space eating planets. The film is a bit short, but over all it's fun and captures the essence of the comic book.

This film is not perfect, but it is entertaining for fans of the series. I hope there will be a third entry in the series. I would like to address some problem with the Thing. I can see cross over's galore in the future and the Thing as he has been presented in these films wouldn't last one second with the Hulk if they ever do battle in a live action film!

M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.

An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivors who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""

All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.

I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work. But he is in dire need of getting his act together. Three bombs in a row does not bode well for any director's future in the industry.

As they become infected, the crew become increasingly violent and insane. As the infected crew becomes more violent and insane, they become more violent and insane.

Quint (played by Jeremy London) and Brodie Bruce (played by the aforementioned Jason Lee) are two best friends, who spend too much time at their local mall, and are then dumped by their girlfriends Brandi Svenning (played by Claire Forlani) and Rene Mosier (played by Shannon Doherty) for being unemployed, immature and overall slackers. TS wants to get married to Brandi, even though he's still in college.

The problem: There is far too much hand wringing over ""torture"" and and other liberal causes (saving africans from genocide, profiling of muslims, Gitmo, evil right wing terrorists) it is difficult to watch.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for.
Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen.
""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe.
Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending.
There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more.
To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"These two movies give Johnny Depp a great opportunity to show his acting range, and he doesn't disappoint.

""Sleepy Hollow"" is perhaps the definitive film version of this well-known tale, though it is not for the faint-of-heart. It gets pretty gory, what with the Headless Horseman out and about his business. We tend to watch this film around Halloween...then see if we can get over its ghastly images by Xmas.

I saw ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway with Len Cariou, Angela Lansbury and Victor Garber many years ago. Cariou and Lansbury were spectacular. Garber, not so much - Sondheim's music for the male ingenue role is pretty ungracious, and neither Garber nor Jamie Campbell Bower in this film version has any success negotiating the vocal writing.

Depp's film Sweeney is a great deal more-frightening and disturbed than what I saw on B'way. That's possible in large part because he doesn't have to project his singing voice and stage persona into a live theatrical space (truth is Depp's singing voice wouldn't project well into the open space of a typical B'way theater without major amplification). That makes for a more-intimate, more-human portrayal, and it's fairly disturbing. The rest of the cast is good as well.

Both films were directed by Tim Burton who seems to get the best out of Depp. The ""By The Sea"" sequence in Sweeney is particularly touching in fleshing out the human sides of Todd and Mrs Lovett that might have been in a way that just isn't possible in the staged version.

If you want to enjoy Sweeney as a disturbed horror flick, get this version. If your main interest is hearing the music, get the 1982 ""Tribute"" version with Lansbury and George Hearn.

Based on J.G. Ballard's novel, I think the late Roger Ebert summed it up nicely when he wrote:

""The movie's general lack of direction leads to what seems like a series of possible endings; having little clear idea of where he was going, Spielberg isn't sure if he has arrived there. The movie's weakness is a lack of a strong narrative pull from beginning to end. The whole central section is basically just episodic daily prison life and the dreams of the boy. Empire of the Sun adds up to a promising idea, a carefully observed production and some interesting performances. But despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me.""

If you want to know what really happened read this passage from Ballard's autobiography Miracles of Life:  ""For me, the most important consequence of internment was that for the first time in my life I was extremely close to my parents. I slept, ate, dressed and undressed within a few feet of them in the same small room, in many ways like the poorer Chinese families for whom I had felt so sorry in Shanghai. But I revelled in this closeness. Lying in bed at night I could, if I wanted to, reach out and take my mother's hand. I flourished in this intimacy, such a contrast to formal English life.""

The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.

The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.

Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"I'd never seen this movie and barely even remembered the title, so as I saw some great reviews I was interested to see what I'd missed. And it wasn't much.

This isn't a bad film (though there is some bad stuff in it) but it just doesn't bring anything new to the genre. It's a revenge flick. Jack Elam, Struther Martin and Ernest Borgnine play outlaw brothers who are inept bank robbers. While being chased by Federales after a bungled bank job they happen upon a ranch where they figure to steal fresh horses. They end up killing the owner and raping his wife, played by Raquel Welch. She comes to, buries her husband and swears revenge.

She meets up with Robert Culp, a bounty hunter, and wants him to teach her the way of the gun. He does, reluctantly, and tries to let her know that it's a bad path she's traveling down.

All of this is OK but it's so middle of the road. We've seen it before many times and seen it better. It's directed OK, it's acted OK (accept for Ernest Borgine who is so terrible you wonder how he ever won an Oscar), it's shot OK, the music is OK. It's just OK.

The 3 Stooges routine between the brothers gets tired fast and, as best I could tell, there is absolutely no reason for the mysterious stranger. The kill scenes aren't particularly clever or exciting, and not that much really happens. The way I see it the only reason for making this film was to put a woman in the revenge seat in general and have her played by Raquel Welch in particular, and she just doesn't have the chops to pull it off.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I knew nothing about Tammy Faye Bakker prior to seeing this film and I was surprised not only at how fascinating her life has been, but also just how fascinating she is period.  The jovial tone of the documentary is really the key to the film for a couple of reasons.  First, it allows us to have fun at Tammy Faye's expense (and besides her make-up, there is still much about her that is worth poking fun at -- the archival footage of the Bakkers hosting a show while Tammy Faye was hooked on prescription drugs is the film's highlight), and her participation in the fun makes it easier for the audience to laugh along.  Secondly, to allow us to look back on her past hardships with so much humour, instead of bitterness, does give the impression that she is one hell of a survivor.  My impression of Tammy Faye before seeing the documentary had been cemented by the mainstream media, which has made her out to be a rich, spoiled and corrupt witch.  So you can imagine my shock as I realized that Tammy Faye had completely won me over by the end of the film.  My immediate reaction to this was that I had been manipulated and I complained that the directors must have felt too much affection for Tammy Faye since the audience was never exposed to the evil side of her character.  However, after considering the film a little more, I realized that Tammy Faye is likely to be too self-unaware and too much of an exhibitionist to actually hide the less pleasant aspects of her personality.  This is what makes her the perfect documentary subject.  Whether the camera is there or not, Tammy Faye's personality is as constant as her permanent eyelashes.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I watched ""One Step Beyond The Official First Season"" over the past 3 days. The show is finally getting the release it deserves.

First - Let's get the only video flaw I found in the entire set out of the way:

In the first 45 seconds of the episode ""Echo"" (on disc 3)there was a good bit of scratches/spots from the original film stock. (most of which was pre-opening monologue and opening title) 45 seconds out of 9 hrs 21 min

That's it!

I noticed no missing frames, Jumps, splices, audio problems or the like anywhere in this set. The episodes were sharp and a joy to watch. I suspect this is from the best 35mm stock.

I have some public domain sets, and they were watchable, but this set blows them away! Stories like The Vision, Night of April 14th, The Dark Room, The Devil's Laughter, and The Return of Michael Campion really benefit from the remastering. There are also stories which I haven't seen in the PD issues.

The set is on three single-sided discs. The extras are somewhat minimal. The best being the extended ""The Bride Possessed"" which included a John Newland series promo that I'd never seen before. Also there is another promo, the Alcoa opening, the 1990's version titles, and a 4 min. 1991 audio interview with Don Mankiewicz (with read-along subtitles).

My 5 star rating takes into account the artistic merit as well as the video. I think these are fine stories well suited to these who enjoy Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone or Thriller.

One Step Beyond fans should really enjoy this well-done set.

For those unfamiliar, One Step Beyond (which began in 1959) was an anthology series which told stories of strange or supernatural events that were based on supposedly true documented cases. Subject matter included hauntings, premonitions, curses, thought transference, miracles, re-incarnation and other bizarre phenomenon.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Based on the novel of the same name by Wiiliam Saroyan, this is a coming of age movie about a teen Homer MacCauley (Mickey Rooney) who takes over as the man of the house when his older brother Marcus (Van Heflin) leaves for WWII. Surprisingly, there is no girl chasing in this movie. Rooney is dead serious as a kid dealing with the changes occurring on the home front and growing up quickly while trying to keep it together for the family which includes his widowed mother play by Fay Bainter, sister Bess (Donna Reed), and brother Ullyses (Jack 'Butch' Jenkins). Thrown into the mix is Homer's often inebriated boss Mr. Grogan (Frank Morgan), the local telegrapher Tom Spangler (James Craig) and Diana Steed (Marsha Hunt as Spangler's romantic interest). While the book primarily deals with life during the war, it is most often viewed through Homer's eyes as he copes with all the changes swirling around him as he works part time at the telegraph office delivering messages most often regarding war casualties.
While this film is populated with a series of vignettes aimed at promoting patriotism, it gets philosophical and spiritual as the dead make commentaries about the changes occurring.
Sappy as it may be, I like this movie. The characters are interesting and the acting is good. The Mickster is oddly affecting as Homer and believable. The casting showcases the talents of a lot of unknown faces such as Reed, Jenkins, Van Johnson, and the bit players include Robert Mitchum, Don Defore, Frank Jenks, Darrel Hickman, Dorothy Morris, Hobart Cavanaugh, Carl(Alfalfa) Switzer, and Barry Nelson.

We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other"" but it was just wine.

Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This 2000 Israeli film is as fresh as today's headlines.  Set in a settlement in Israel it's about a radical rabbi and his ardent followers, two best friends who compete for the rabbi's daughter, and the ongoing conflicts of orthodoxy and secularism in Israel.

The film is as bleak as the landscape around the settlement.  And the rabbi's radicalism is the one thing that keeps the young men bound together.  One of them is in the army and creates a religious unit much to the concern of his superiors who distrust the radicalism, even though the soldiers perform well.  Another young man is the scholar and the rabbi wants him to marry his daughter.  Alas, though, she prefers the soldier.  Trouble follows.  She leaves the settlement and goes to the city where she finds an apartment with some other religious young women.

Her rejection of her religious suitor, however, pushes him to plan to commit a radical act and he involves the soldier as well as another innocent friend in the plan.  How this all plays out is scary, as we are all aware of the potential violence of terrorist attacks.  This film brings this all out as well as some complex psychological factors.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"The overall production quality of ""Lansky"" is barely adequate. This HBO TV special comes across as a film made under severe time and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the acting talent of Richard Dreyfuss is utterly fantastic. The now middle-aged star gives a performance that ranks among his very best. Dreyfuss clearly understands this low keyed Jewish gangster who lead much of American organized crime in the previous century. The character actor Max Perlich also does a splendid job of portraying Lansky during his earlier years. Perlich is a skillful thespian who deserves greater respect and attention. He ought to have received at least an Academy Award nomination for his splendid supporting work in ""Rush.""
Meyer Lansky was something of a highly intelligent mob boss who essentially perceived himself as a misunderstood polite business man; neither better nor worse than the titans of that era's capitalist business organizations. Lansky rationalizations conveniently ignored the fact that murder and other forms of violence are not everyday realities of conventional American capitalism. Lansky, though, was probably correct to conclude that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Estes Kefauver hounded him mostly out of less than noble reasons.
""Lansky"" accurately depicts the Jewish gangsters as far more intelligent than those generally found in other ethnic groups. Also, the Meyer Lanskys, ""Bugsy"" Siegels, and Alfred Rothsteins were the only generation of that ethnic tradition that chose careers in organized crime. Their progeny did not follow in their father's footsteps! Meyer Lansky, for instance, made sure that his own son attended West Point and became a U.S. military officer. ""Lansky"" earns four stars.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Way before she grabbed an Oscar nomination for her searing performance as a world-weary prostitute in Leaving Las Vegas, Elisabeth Shue was known as one of the squeaky-clean actresses of the '80s.

Having made a smash in ""The Karate Kid"" and the '60s-nostalgia TV series ""Call to Glory"", Shue cemented her good-girl reputation with the charming but badly titled Adventures in Babysitting.

Set in the John Hughes-style suburbs of Chicago, the titular adventures follow babysitter Chris (Elisabeth Shue), who agrees to watch the Anderson kids (Keith Coogan and Maia Brewton) when her boyfriend cancels their anniversary date.

All is quiet on the home front until Chris is called upon to rescue her best friend (Penelope Ann Miller, also doing good-girl duty) from the seedy downtown bus station. She can't leave the kids, and she can't leave her friend alone in the big bad city, so she packs everyone in the station wagon and heads into Chicago.

Screwball craziness begins as they encounter car thieves, knife-wielding gangs, gun-toting truck drivers, and, worst of all, Chris's duplicitous boyfriend. It's hardly mature entertainment, but Shue makes it work; when she wins over the audience at a blues club with her improv singing, you'll be won over, too.

In his directorial debut, Chris Columbus (who later went on to helm the sap-fests Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone) gently skewers the suburbia white-bread mindset of the main characters, and plays up the comedy over the schmaltz with a subtlety of which he now seems incapable; the near romance between Shue and Coogan is played lightly and adorably.

Look for brief appearances by art-house faves Lolita Davidovich as a college party girl and Vincent D'Onofrio as an unlikely savior.

So far, everything is great. Well, it might not be great exactly, but you can at least expect a decent family picture like ""Sky High.""

However, the film is helmed by a wrong director, Peter Hewitt, whose previous works include first ""Garfield"" movie and ""Thunderpants"" (just in case you haven't seen it, the latter is a one-joke film about a farting boy). For all the charms and the talent of the cast, and the characters' likable nature, those would-be superheroes/heroines becoming transparent or making the body and limbs bigger like rubber ball, have already been done in ""The Incredibles"" or other films of the same genre.

The film's weak script, which does not explain convincingly why these kids must be brought together and trained like this, is already a problem. But the saddest thing is, for me, watching Chevy Chase covered with greenish sticky slime coming out of a boy's nose. It's a worse kind of gag than pie-throwing.

I like Tim Allen, but it makes me sad to see his recent films like this and ""The Shaggy Dog.""

Thus terrorism in the modern era is the means by which oligarchies wage secretwars against peoplewhich it would be politically impossible to wage openly. In Germany, Detlev Karsten Rohwedder was the cheif of thr Trusteeship Agency which in 1991 was the largest corporation in the world. In the communist German Democratic Republic(GDR) collapsed in 1989, all industry that was property of the state & was transferred to the Trusteeship Agency. Rohweeder, as the haed of this entity, preferred to keep the vast state property of the GDR as a state sector to maintain existing levels of employment and production so as to facilitate the absorbtion of the East German regions into a unified Germany. Anglo-American financiers wanted all the GDR state property to be put on the auction block at once, so that it could be sold off at bargain basement prices to Wall Street & the City of London. When Rohwedder proved reluctant to accept this policy he was assinated by elements claiming to be the Baader-Meinhof group. Rohwedder's successor immediately began selling off GDR state property the way the City of London/Anglo Americans wanted. Two other celebrated signature cases are the elimation of Enrico Mattei, the president of the Italian state oil company and the German banker Juergen Ponto by the Baader-Meinhof gang  protrayed well in this movie. It is evident that the Baader-Meinhof was acting asa false-flag operation for CIA and MI-6. Putting this as a backdrop the the film increases its importance significantly and allows the viewer to connect the missing dots.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"First let me say that I wish they'd allow us to rate half-star intervals here; I'd have given this another half-star, mostly due to the great lines given to Arye Gross. I never heard of the guy before, but he's hilarious  here in the role of unlikely hero (that also doesn't want to be hero). Reminds me just a little of the Ash character in ""Army of  Darkness"" or the Jack Burton character in ""Big Trouble in Little  China"". It's Arye Gross' performance that raises this film above  mediocrity. Without his character, the movie would be a plain-jane sci-fi  movie with nothing special about it. Except Maryam D'Abo, whose  sexiness could almost carry the whole thing by itself. Mind you, the  character she plays isn't a particularly sexy character, but her subtle  beauty shows through anyway, and between her and Gross, there is always  something worth watching going on. The supporting cast, Jeff Speakman,  etc. , perform quite well also, and the bad guys are convincingly  evil-looking. The production standards are strictly B-movie however. Special effects are okay but not great, and the settings are sort of  cliched. There are several close-up shots of an asteroid that is pretty  obviously a miniature, but it adds a little charm to it that way--kind of  like watching an old sci-fi movie from the 50's. But understand that I  don't think this movie is trying to be anything but a B-movie. All in  all a standard sci-fi movie with great humor sprinkled throughout. I  laughed out loud many times while watching it. It's worth spending money  on, but just don't expect Oscar-winning stuff here. And now I have to go  see what other movies Arye Gross has been in.

Movies_and_TV_5,2,OR,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol was a bad producer, Morrissey was a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actors to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just looks so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT has the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brothers who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claims to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he gets naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walks out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she gives the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, adds his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breasts or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Having had to sit through the ""horror"" films that the Hollywood studios have given hideous birth to these past couple of years, I was in the mood for some good old fashioned imported hair raising terror. I had read about this film before going to see it, mostly because I had read a novel of the same title by Jeff Long which is about a terrifying cave exploration gone wrong, but this movie directed by Neil Marshall is a completely different story although similar in its originality. I dragged my husband to see this last night, promising him a different experience than all the horror movies as of late. We both are sick of paltry remakes of Japanese films, and big budget stinkers that involve lots of water and hair, and rely heavily on computer generated scares , This movie is a serious monster movie for a generation without monster movies. I really missed the good old days where the baddies were flesh and bone; the stories were fresh and didn't need too much elaboration, and I had the chance to see some unknowns get massacred. This movie delivered all that to us and more, its scary but not cheesy it has unknowns which is so rare nowadays to see a fresh face in a imaginative movie. it had an awesome story line, that was full of symoblism of course but not so blatant that you were rolling your eyes and saying ""okay, cave wombs, blood, rebirth i get it"" the movie also had great effects for a 6 million dollar budget, and I left feeling like I had a refreshing adrenaline horror filled enema, cleansing all the ""the saws, the grudges, the rings, the darkwaters, etc"" out of my system.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Acorn Media has provided the DVD with english subtitles which are helpful not only to people who have hearing impediments but to foreigners (specially when politician explain very quickly intricate schemes, with names of men we know nothing about). The story is very interesting from an historical point of view. It begins with Napoleon III being dismissed and ends some times after the Second World War is over. Politics are not seen from Sirius, but through magnifying glasses: dayly and often cynical calculations, fights against political ennemies or so-called friends. Randolph's every days life is a sort of thrilling gambling. For instance, he resigns his charge, thinking the government will become aware it can't do without him; in case it doesn't  Randolph will found a new Tory group, modern, kenner on social issues, and overcome the old Tory party. We see how times are changing: at the beginning of the story, upper classes are extremely conservative, prjudiced with birth, wealth, morals, etc and at the end, one of Jennie's niece, an artist, goes to Russia on her own to see what communism is like. Lady Churchill is a fascinating woman! Clever, brave, ambitious, free, quite different from the other women of her time. With such  ""political beasts"" as his father and mother were, we understand why Winston Churchill (remarkably played by Warren Clark) was so outstanding a stateman. Love stories don't lack in the movie; I found particularly moving the love affair between Jennie and the long-suffering Count Kinsky (embodied by the wonderful Jeremy Brett; if you like him, look at ""posthumous Bafta for Jeremy Brett"" on facebook).Though many tragic events occur (Randolph illness and demise, wars...), the dialogues, always brilliant, are often amusing: clever, cynical, sparkling with wit. People of the high society are depicted in a satirical way. Everything is beautiful: houses, costumes, music, actors: Lee Remick, Jeremy Brett...I find 361 minutes were hardly enough.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Any of those who would dismiss this movie for its allegedly senseless violence or because they feel it's a pale imitation of Pulp Fiction simply do not understand Mexican culture.  Violence, verbal or physical, proliferates in Mexican culture; I think many of the reviewers (mostly overly sensitive gringos, I would gather) who are uncomfortable with this movie would probably be equally uncomfortable with the Mexican view of life inherited from the Spaniards--i.e., the fatalism, the grim resignation to the frequent ugliness and brutality of life, and a sort of crude vivacity.  Pienso que estas personas que no les gusta Mxico no tienen cojones.  But then again, most people want illusion not reality at the movies, which brings up the next point.
As for the Pulp Fiction charge, this movie bears about as much relation to that movie as Picasso, in his early, rough stage, does to Andy Warhol's soup cans.  In Amores Perros, the violence, and, hence, the feeling, is real; in Pulp Fiction, it's trendy posing.  We cringe at the gore and we giggle at the jokes, then we forget the whole pop culture souffl Tarantino has served up.  The people in Amores Perros are blood and guts--crude, yes, and occassionally ugly, but there's no doubt they're the real thing.  Quentin Tarantino has never delved this deeply.
I give this movie four stars instead of five because it's still at times subject to a youthful impetuousness that fits the first story beautifully but not the other two.  It's not quite great, but it's still mighty impressive.  And the middle story about the model losing her leg and enduring a romantic crisis with her lover is in the end rather tiresome--it's undeniably felt by the actors, but it seems like tawdry bourgeois angst or an episode from a melodramatic telenovela next to the urban blight and horrors of the first and third stories.",0

As a sign of the tribe's gratitude, they help train a horse from the ranch, and they help get the hay crop in on time.

BEHIND THE SCENES: Live action Disney classic. Keenan Wynn, Nancy Olson, and Chief Dan George also star in this movie, and a good song written by Bobby Russell for the movie is featured, ""The Ballad of Smith and Gabriel Jimmyboy"". While production was started initially by James Algar, Bill Anderson took over as producer fairly early. One of the studios greatest producers, Anderson saw the fim as a chance to appeal to a more mature audience that a typical Disney film, vital to Disney's growth. Directed by Michael O'Herlihy. The story had been adapted by studio staff storyman Louis Pelletier from a book by Paul St. Pierre titled, ""Breaking Smith's Quarter Horse"". This movie was released to theaters on March 21, 1969, and was released on video in 1987. It never featured on ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" television show. It is 102 minutes in length.

Released almost two years after Walt's death, this film was almost unseen by the public since a top studio executive hated the film based on only a few scenes. He cut all funding for promotion of the film so there was no audience waiting to see it.

I read a negative review of it (by a professional critic I think) who said the first part was good, well made, but the 2nd part was not. This person missed the whole point.  First she gave the twist in the story so anyone reading the critique would not have this surprise and then she missed a lot of the undertones in the 2nd part. For instance she said ""he meets a young girl who happens to be a butoh dancer and that happens to be what his wife wanted to be"". That says it all, how the person misunderstood the whole story.  In fact the person goes to Japan to find the answer to the death  he cannot accept and in the first part we see his wife at a butoh performance in Berlin, the two parts of the movie tie in exactly. Also there is a clear analysis or how people view and deal with death in the east and the west. The young girl (the butoh dancer in Tokyo) has lost her mother and there is a poignant scene where she compares her mother to a duck (!! up and down, up and down) and gives a very sharp clue as to her mother's death. Also she has been rendered homeless from this death, her situation is quite desperate but in fact she deals with death so much better than our character who is trying to understand his loss from a western point of view.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

Of course, it helps that I love Bob.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,4,CG,"'Say Die Strom (is that what it is?).  The film is a turn-off for the young (and the old) people, and the social class.  It is very much like a family movie, with a good script, good acting, and a good story.

""Die Strom"" is a great family movie, and I hope it continues to be like this.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I have a hard time finding anything that could have been better.

If you like family, you will love this movie!  It is a movie that is well-made, well-acted, and well-written.  The only thing that is missing is a good dose of humor.  This movie is not for everyone, and it should be avoided at all costs.

A good review is provided in the DVD section.  You can view the entire movie in its entirety.

To conclude, this is a great family movie.  The acting, the story, and the direction are excellent.  The movie is a must-see, and it will be enjoyed by any family.  I recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I don't care for the negative reviews.  I love family movies!I love this series, the costumes, the music, and the story.  This is an excellent collection.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"The music is, as expected, brilliant.  The sets and cinematography are magnificient.  Adrien Brody, as usual, puts in an excellent performance---he has probably the most expressive eyes in cinema.  The script is also solid, few dead spots anywhere.
What keeps this from being a *great* film, however, is Roman Polanski's lack of discipline as a director, or apparently the lack of strong producers willing to trim off all the fat---and boy is there ever lots of fat!  At 2-1/2 hours, this film actually felt twice as long as ""Schindler's List"" which is over 3 hours and covers a much wider scope!  It takes forever to depict a few simple scenes (for example, a starving Brody trying to open a can of cucumbers) and characters (such as Brody's family during the Nazi takeover of Warsaw).  I get the impression that Polanski was given this free hand out of ""sensitivity"" rather than artistic good sense, simply because he himself was a Holocaust survivor.
The result is that unlike ""Schindler's List"" this film has almost no recognizable subtext.  It's been promoted as a ""tale of survival"" or ""one man surviving for the sake of his love of his music"" but in actuality it feels more like a very slow documentary.  Brody actually spends very little time onscreen playing the piano...the first 2/3 of the film mainly centers around the hellish life of Polish Jews herded into the Warsaw Ghetto before getting shipped off to concentration camps.  Brody's character seems less of a tenacious survivor than a bumbling, dazed butterfly---saved mainly by one fortuitous turn of events after another rather than any Herculean personal efforts.
Due to the bloated pacing and relatively passive central character, ""The Pianist"" lacks any clear focus and never develops any consistent momentum.  The viewer, like Brody's character, just sits there waiting for it all to end---we WATCH things happpening, but are never made a PART of them.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"A mother/son road trip movie is sort of an uncharted journey in the film world. That made this a very unique film from the start.. Based on an actual road trip that Fogelman took with his mother is probably what makes the movie so real. Streisand and Rogen have great chemistry and since the movie is 80% just them, that is a godsend. Joyce's constant need to interfere with Andy's life in almost every aspect drives him crazy until an explosion of unexpected drama on the part of mother and son. There are so many funny lines and situations that the theatre was filled with laughter often. The movie could also take a very serious, moving turn which can move you to tears.
 Streisand has always been an actress of immeasurable range from musicals (Funny Girl) to comedy (What's Up Doc?) to drama (The Way We Were) with each type being a blockbuster hit.  In her semi-retirement she works very seldom.  It took them a year to convince her to come back to her first lead role in many years.  Her Joyce is perhaps one of the most real characters she has ever played  Stripped of glamour she wears track shoes and sneakers.  She is just a regular mother who lives for the happiness of her son.  Rogen has rarely played such a straight character as Andy.  Anne Fletcher has brought out the best of them both.  The climatic showdown is pure real dramatic that Streisand delivers with a powerful punch that stuns the audience as much as Andy.
. I liked everything about this film and can't wait to see it again. Don't skip the end because there are a lot of clips after the credits of mother and son banter that is very funny.
This is a great film for parents and grown children. I wish my mother was still alive- I'd love to take her to see it.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This is a long 2 part story. It appears to be made for Canadian TV. No sex, nudity, or bad language. Like American movies, the bad guys are black, except in this one they speak French Canadian. The main bad guys hang out in Switzerland and boast a mish-mash of indistinguishable international accents, including one female (Belladonna Lithia) whose haircut makes me think she was once part of the Swedish Bikini team of the 1980's.

Ryan Carnes plays Chris Mooore, who lives with people he thinks are his parents. Like Luke Skywalker his past is kept secret and then one day he comes home, finds his legal guardians killed by the bad guys and vows revenge. Like Spiderman, he also likes the redhead next door. And there is a corporate meeting which reminded me of the one in Kill Bill.

Chris Moore has lost his memory and doesn't know he is the Phantom, although he does like to jump around the roofs of buildings. Once he is arrested, his DNA goes out on the Interpol network and he is discovered by the Good Guys and the Bad Guys, the Singh. Eventually Chris assumes the role of the Phantom and uses his new high tech bullet proof suit. It turns out his dad died from cancer (must have been those purple dyed asbestos fibers in the old suit). The bad guys have  a weapon called ""Flicker"" or Flickr for you Yahoos or Flicka for you cowboys. This device uses digital TV to turn people into Manchurian Candidates, who will keep the war machine going and the arms dealers rich.

The movie doesn't have long drawn out action scenes. It is long on dialogue and building characters. If this is the first in a series. i.e. an introduction of characters, they did a good job. However, if this is it, you might wait until you have 3 hours to kill on a movie that is more carrot on a stick than action.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I'm not a comic reader and have never read the ones for Spiderman, I'm more of a movie fan so if you are looking for a review that compares this movie to the comics this review may not be helpful for that.  I have watched the Spiderman trilogy that came out in the 2000s and thought they were pretty well done, but for some reason I enjoyed this Spiderman more.  For example, I found the character of Spiderman rather annoying in the trilogy whereas I could relate to his character better in this one.  I also like how this version had more background to the story as it started off with Peter Parker as a child living with his parents and touches a little bit upon his dad and how he was a very secretive man.  I also found the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane really annoying in the Trilogy but the relationship he had with Gwen Stacy was more realistic and not over dramatized.  The fighting scenes were typical superhero style of fast paced and lots of smashing with the hero seeming to be the weaker out of the two but that is what is expected from these movies.  Of course there were many similarities played out differently in this movie when compared to the first of the older Trilogy.  For example, the spider bite, the fate of the uncle, Peter letting a thieve go due to his irritation with the person being robbed, the split personality of the villain, and so on.  They were just played out quite differently.  Peter Parker in this movie was also much funnier I thought; especially when he is dealing with the car thieve.  I found it to be an overall enjoyable movie and just about anyone who likes action will like it and my 6-year-old son really enjoyed it so it is a good movie for the younger generation.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I was a tiny tot--like one of Don Draper's kids, at the time of the events depicted in this season, and this series makes me feel I can make windows into my parents' world, even into their souls.

Dick Whitman's transformation into Don Draper is a brilliant trope, which operates both on the level of metaphor and plot, & is key to characterization.

Even if Dick Whitman had never switched dog tags with his dead commanding officer in Korea, he would have done everything possible to reinvent himself--and obliterate his past.  His ambition drives him into a brave new world in which he, rather like a master spy, must be the bravest.  The new name and social security number make this much more real & palpable, while generating practical complications which fuel the plot and allow us tantalizingly brief glimpses of the bleak world which drove him to his desperate deception.

Poignantly, he hands his half brother $5,000, a large sum in the early 1960's, to, as Dick/Don puts it, ""make a new life for yourself,"" to be another ""Don Draper,"" and vanish from Don's world.  But his brother misses the mark.  For mysterious reasons, he hangs himself.  In doing so, the half-brother's feeble surrender to fate becomes not only a foil for Don's strength, and the boldness of his social/psychological imagination, but an index of the ruthlessness with which he is prepared to ""murder his past.""

Looking at this series from the outside, the sets, costumes, automobiles, & etc., are every bit as authentic as other celebrated period dramas like Downton Abbey.  And in the the social realm, the casual racism, sexism, and class consciousness is perfect down to every dowdy pleat in Peggy Olson's skirt, every limp lock of hair in her bangs, every note of assumed superiority in Peter Campbell's prep school accent.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"Wesley Snipes plays an undercover CIA agent in Romania. Pitted against this perpetually angry hero (whose emotions are delivered with bland voice-over) is a sexy and strong-willed Russian beauty played by Silvia Colloca. Snipes must protect Colloca going back to USA from the attacks of the villains of this country, whose motives I'm still trying to figure out.

There is no denying that this is a low-budget action film made in Romania, kind of film you watch for shoot-outs and explosions. To their credits, the stunt persons of the film did a decent job and in one memorable scene a baddie falls out of the window (of the second floor of a house) and falls onto the roof of a van below, hitting his head against it really hard and bouncing like a rubber ball. That is amazing. And don't forget the cat-and-mouse chase scene in the subway where a bald-headed baddie shows one surprising stunt.

But the rest of the film is very dull. ""The Detonator"" uses every clichd element of action genre taken directly from other better films, and throws them into the convoluted narrative in the wrong way. The film attempts to be different with a portrait of a gangster who owns a soccer team and several scenes about soccer games. However, it just doesn't work because of the tepid descriptions of games and banal action sequences mixed with them.

It was in 2004 when we saw the third entry of `The Blade' which was not bad.

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all
occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special
effects, others the story.

In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are
keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the
movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a
glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a
small 7-11 style store in a major city.

William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,
and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the
tough-guy with a big heart role.

The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,
such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION
but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that
will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those
over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of
human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles
that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.
The key here, is showing people their human sides, and
willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in
peace with one another, responsibly.

Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed
with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in
each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""
or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target
the below 17 age bracket.

Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to
enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting
talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.

As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my
favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in
this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not
unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd
that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,
such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,
or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances
with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a
different phase of her life than before, but in
SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your
attention.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"Any single Justice League animated TV episode makes this film look like the Superfriends from the 1970's, and there simply is no excuse.  Animation studios with amazing talent are everywhere, and Marvel certainly has enough cash after successes like the Spiderman and X-Men films.  Though they tried to put in elements from the brilliantly developed characters in the Ultimates comic series, each scene was rushed, giving no time for emotional involvement.  That, combined with chunky animation, leaves you with little ability to suspend your disbelief and really feel for these characters.

The animation of Giant Man's growth was unimpressive, when it should have been imposing and awe striking.  Wasp's growth, having her wings disappear into nothing only after she's fully grown shows a ridiculously poor understanding by the animators and directors of how her power is supposed to work.

Outside of the animation itself are the pacing, directing and editing of this film.  Each segue was hard and roughly paced.  Camera angles were sharp and characters badly proportioned within them-possibly in an attempt to be stylized.  Scenes were poorly framed.  Character dialogue was unrealistically fast and either emotionally shallow or over the top.  The best voice actor in the film was Andre Ware as Nick Fury, but he's had a lot of experience in the DC animated universe, and it's apparent that experience helped him here.

Marvel studios haven't shown an increase in technical or storytelling skill from the Spider Friends, Spiderwoman or original X-Men animated series in any way and it's unfortunate, because with Mark Millar's incredible storytelling and Bryan Hitch's innovative character design, this could have launched a whole new era for Marvel animation.

I even tried to give this a 2 star rating, just for seeing these characters on the screen, but I can't bring myself to do it.  JLU and the DC animated universe have raised the bar on both storytelling and animation quality.

Step up to the plate, Marvel.  Play time's over.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"When it comes to B-movies, Bloodsucking Freaks is ranked right up there with the best of them. What more could you want from a film? It has sex, violence, lots of nudity, and a crazed afro-wearing midget. Don't let the title fool you though. This movie has nothing to do with vampires, in fact except for one great scene, there really isn't much bloodsucking at all. The scene I speak of is the 'doctor' and his 'operation'. A beautiful nude blonde is strapped to a chair. First the doc pulls all her teeth out with a pair of pliers (this is to ensure she doesn't bite). Then he shaves the top of her head, drills a hole through the center of her skull, inserts a tube and sucks out the blood and gray matter. Fascinating.

There are so many scenes in this movie it is difficult to describe them all. The spanking guillotine scene is a favorite of mine, espescially what the midget does with the head after he takes it out of the basket. The midget is one weird little dude, he has a craving for human eyes, always wins at backgammon (another great scene) and is a hell of a little cymbal player.

The plot for this flick is pretty simple. A weird dude operates an S&M torture show in New York. This is a front for his white slavery business. When he's not performing with his cast, he simply tortures whoever is available. He has a cage of cannibalistic wenches that he keeps locked up too. They are good for disposing of any unwanted snoops.

Even the cop who finally busts him gets eaten. There are no winners here, good guys and bad guys die alike. Well the cannibal women do get free and eat their master, so I guess that's good. The final scene before the 'THE END' pops up is hilarious. You'll never eat a hot dog again without thinking of 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.

So enjoy this movie for what it is. I do.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.

She had no one to go to and had to eat dog food to survive. The scenes where she was having to try to cook her own dog food and gravy dinner, light a stove with a blow torch and within moments it all explodes.

The fire is all around her and one waits for her to be consumed by the smoke and flames. Suddenly her father appears and chases her out. They race through the swamp, she in terror he in a drunken anger. The scenes of all the drunkeness from the men and women and the wildness of the children...I did not find to be anything but painful. The flooding of the Bathtub area was sad and the hundreds of animals drowned was a reminder of how horrific this storm was. How little help was given left me wondering. They tried to give help but the people did not want to leave what they had...I understand that, but I did not find this to be all that great a film. I guess the father taught the daughter how to survive, and as he was dying it was evident he did love her, but it left me wondering about her future. I have been orphaned, abandoned, homeless, and terrified, but I lived in a major city and had three jobs at one time to try to survive. I guess it is a city person trying to understand a backwoods-swamp existence. The hopelessness was not to my liking.

Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Michael Weiss and the other creators of this redux of the Jules Verne classic posit that someone who actually made the trip to the center of the earth through a volcanic tube told the story to Verne. In short, Trevor Anderson (Fraser) is a struggling geologist who has been trying for ten years to prove his brother Max's theory that the Jules Verne tale is real.  Trevor's inherited project is about to be closed down when his sister in law brings his 13-year-old nephew, Sean, (Hutcherson) to stay for a couple of days.

Along with Sean's baggage is a box of Max's things, including his hand-annotated version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" Based on Max's notes, Trevor realizes that his brother actually was close to proving his theories before he disappeared. Coincidentally, the geological conditions are perfectly matched to those under which Max died.

This brings Trevor and Sean to Iceland, where Max was last seen.  They hire mountain guide, Hannah (Briem),  who was also the daughter of another Vernian, to take them up the mountain to one of Max's monitoring sites.

Through a freak accident, they end up falling through a cave down into the center of the earth.  Thus, their journey to return begins.  You will see elements of the threats from the original novel--in 3D if your theatre supports it.  Much of the film is a wild ride with vestiges of ""Temple of Doom"" style mine shafts and water slides that will leave you gasping.

The 3D effects are pretty stunning, which is probably the best part of the film with a few touching scenes included between Trevor and Sean.  Overall, seeing the remake was a satisfying experience intensified by the special effects.

Note:  Due to 3D, my theatre had a surcharge for the glasses which made the matinee price of the film close to $[...].

Warning:  Those with vertigo, migraines, seizures or other motion-triggered illnesses might want to use caution in seeing this film.

After seeing it twice, I agree with much (but not all) of the positive five star reviews. Out of respect for those who READ reviews, I'll not repeat everything that I like about the presentation. I found the goofy oversize earrings, hairdo, and facial hair arrangement of Daniel Vitalis, (described as a ""Wild Food Expert"") distracting. UGH. Ditto for David Wolfe, who had an extremely goofy wild hairdo. On the other hand, Jon Gabriel, described as an ""author and weight loss expert"" was nicely groomed and a good presenter. His story of personal transformation of a fellow of over 400 pounds (whew) to becoming a jock of normal weight was inspiring. Christiane Northrup preserves her rank as one of America's cutest doctors. A really nice looking woman! Presentations by Dr. Mercola, Jason Vale, Kris Carr, Alejandro Junger were fine. It was disappointing to have Jamie Oliver (so popular in the UK) give Baby Cow Growth Fluid a pass with unscientific but popular ideas on milk. None of the presenters had anything (ZILCH) to say about the work of Doctor T. Colin Campbell. Milk does a body bad. It was good to see all presenters take a stand against sugar. They all agreed on the evils of sugar and refined carbohydrates. With all respect to Dr. Northrup, her ""It's not fat that makes you fat - it's sugar"" statement will not pass muster in the community of experts. Recognizing the evils of sugar should NOT be mutually exclusive to recognizing the proven dangers of fat - particularly fat from dead animals - and EXTRACTED fat of ALL kinds. Olive Oil is NOT a health food.

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.

Both woman in this film got no redeeming qualities what so ever. The back story behind the original lead actor is pretty crazier. Even crazier a guy named Wade Williams supposedly bought old movies. That I guess conveniently went into public domain not long after. He made some cash & re-made this film. It's nice to see someone be so passionate about a film.

I wish it had been a better 1, but the re-creation & great use of color is good. Of course their are much better noir's out their in color & don't cost 50 Dollars for a damn VHS.

It has been said by some that the plot has holes or doesn't make sense in places. I have plotted it out meticullously and i can find a hole anywhere.  Because the plot is involved it is a movie that gets better with repeated viewings. Much like watching ""The Usual Suspects"" for the second & third time. Something else I think is noteworthy is that while most of the movie is kind of cold and lonely,as it should be, as our hero goes on his quest where no one can be trusted, at the very end of the movie we are treated to a very warm, hopeful, satisfying ending. All the cast are perfect.  Lucy Lui has the perfect demeanor for this role. Many times it is hard to read her and thereby to know if she can be trusted.

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"I will say it up front, yes this was a film never previously seen in America, maybe it still has not been. It is from the 1970's, and just about outdoes most other genre entries (no pun intended) in terms of the degree of sleaze radiating off the screen.

Another film where you could speed the film up 4-5 times and quite easily follow the plot, what little there is of it.

I found it interesting to study the eyes of the people 'acting' in this film, there is a lot of uneasiness amid the sleaze on show.

It is really a straight porn shoot (and it is without a doubt X-rated) with one or two lesbian scenes which would have been pretty radical for those days (I'm guessing).

To give an indication of the story and plot standard, the short sex scenes which were often threatening to break out into a very laid back orgy, well those X-rated scenes were the actual highlight of the entire mess on show.

It must have cost a fair bit to make, as it is well shot for the era, and whoever was behind the camera had at least some idea of what they were doing.

I cannot comment on the dialogue as I couldn't bear to expose myself to it (it was dubbed anyway I think, which compounds the agony).

And if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD based on the jacket featuring a gorilla obviously rather taken with a diverting buxom blonde, you will be sadly disappointed.

There is a lame sex scene involving the bloke in the gorilla suit, with a young woman who obviously is unhappy, does not want her face caught on film, and raises the possibility whether she was aware of what was going on or even whether she felt under a little duress during that scene.

Which brings me back to the central point, yes, this is sleaze with a capital 'S'; you sort of do get what was advertised, but it is so tame and takes itself seriously by today's 'standards' it is almost quaint.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!  Oh well, that's modern film-making for you -- where directors and writers confuse their own aspirations for social change and ""influencing the masses"" with authentic telling of history.  Advice: stick to authentic documentaries, and keep fresh batteries in your BS detector.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"From the beginning episode of season 1, I was hooked on this show.  It's a nuanced series of tightly plotted stories with a running series of subplots that slowly build from the beginnning.  The individual stories are not always what they seem - from the outset, the viewer knows that not all the people Reese and Finch try to help are victims - quite often, they are the perps that Reese has to stop before they commit whatever crime they have planned.

Of course, there are some clunkers but even the bad shows are superior to a lot of the dreck currently being aired on TV - broadcast or cable.

Before the show premiered, Jonathan Nolan, the series creator, called it Batman without the cape.  And, like all good hero/anti-hero franchises, this show has its own support 'family' as well as a marvelous rogues gallery with some enemies fixed seemingly permantently in the mythos and others appearing and eventually being handled.  Some, such as Elias, a mob boss out to control the NY rackets, start to slip into the show with mentions episodes before the character appears.

Many of these allies and rogues carry on into the new season which successfully opened with the resolution to the season 1 cliffhanger.  The flashbacks continue to reveal the backgrouds and motivations of Reese and Finch as well as the supporting cast - good guy or bad guy.  Fortunately, unlike producer JJ Abram's earlier success ""Lost"", this are much more defined & explain more - propelling the episode along.  (I love ""Lost"" but the flashbacks and flashforwards did get a bit confusing.)

I watched season 1 again then season 2 before season 3 premiered (several mini-marathons involved).  Each time I watch it, I see or hear something I missed before that enhances the show.  Some even have significance as the series goes on.

This is one of the very few Must-See shows for me.  And the only one on one of the big 4 networks.

And I'm already planning to buy season 3.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,4,CG,"Temple of Doom is infamous for its suave, yet violent scenes.

The film has a weak plot.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's a little too much of a hack job.  This movie is still fun to watch.  The only problem with this movie is that the monsters are too scary to be scary.  They're just too big to be scary.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the voice acting.  You'd think that a scary monster would be scary, but it's a little too scary to be scary.  The movie is probably the best part of the movie, especially if you like zombies and vampires.  It's just too scary to be scary.  If you're a fan of the film, then this is probably the movie for you.  You can't go wrong with this one.  You can't go wrong with this one.  I'm not going to say anything about the other films, just say that it's a good movie.I am a huge fan of the series.  I grew up watching it, and I am very pleased with the choices that this series has made.  I'm also glad to have a few episodes of the show.  The series is a perfect continuation of the previous seasons.  I enjoyed the show even more, and I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of the series.This movie is a must see for any fan of the series, especially those that enjoyed the original series. I love the production and the story.  This is a must see for any fan of the series.  It is very entertaining and very",1
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.",0
Movies_and_TV_5,2,CG,"As others have noted, in this movie, the movie is set in a world that is not just a closed society but a world where most people have no basic rights, so it is not surprising that many people in the movie are in a position to enjoy the movie.  There are many people who have no rights because they do not have a basic right and are in a situation where they are forced to live with the consequences of their actions.  In this case, the movie is based on the book of the same name by the late writer William Wordsworth.  Wordsworth is famous for his work, and he wrote many great novels, including his famous ""The Tempest.""  Wordsworth's novel was inspired by the book of the same name and was the inspiration for the movie.

The movie also features some of the very best actors in the movie.  The film is directed by William Shakespeare and the cast is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and a good acting performance.

The movie was made in the mid-1950s by John Henry Ewing, who was a large, well-known actor in Hollywood.  Henry Ewing was the son of the legendary actor William Ewing and was born in England in 1885.  Henry Ewing's father was a big comic actor who played a major role in the movie.  He was known as a hard-bitten and gruff man, but his father's character was very sympathetic and kind.  Henry Ewing's father was very good at sports, but his mother was a bit too shy and a bit too violent.  In the movie, Ewing is a bit of a troublemaker who",1
Movies_and_TV_5,1,OR,"""Old Joy"" is a movie about a dog named Lucy. Lucy has an owner named Mark who is about to become a father. With his wife about to give birth, Mark takes off for an overnight road trip. Lucy likes this because she gets to ride along. Mark goes and gets his old friend Kurt. Kurt likes to smoke hoochie-choochie weed, but this is okay with Lucy because Kurt will pet her head enthusiastically and throw a stick for her. Lucy runs in the forest and finds a nice big stick. Kurt is taking Mark to a natural spring. Kurt gets lost. The men sit on an abandoned sofa next to a fire and play with an air gun while Lucy looks over at them. Lucy is played by Lucy the dog. She has wonderful dog expressions and a very perky tail that wags wildly with enthusiasm. Her owner Mark is played by Daniel London who was in ""Rent,"" ""The Minority Report"" & ""Patch Adams. ""  London turns in a good subtle performance as he says the right things to his friend, while constantly talking with his wife on the phone and being critical of Kurt. It's obvious that Mark has moved beyond this old buddy relationship. Kurt the buddy is played by Will Oldham who was in ""Junebug. ""  When they get to the sauna, the guys take off their clothes and Kurt tries to give Mark a massage. Mark is not comfortable with this. There are a lot of trees in the film. Kino International transferred it from 16 mm to 35 mm. It's being called artistic because it takes a long time to do very little. We get to watch sky and trees flicker by on the windshield for about four minutes. Actually, this is neither profound nor entertaining. It's a pretentious bit of cinema. That said, Lucy should have received a nomination as best animal in a movie.",0

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This is an excellent documentary about Allen's entire career.  There are many, many film clips and they are all choice highlights from his films.  Interspersed with these clips are interview segments with Allen present day and during earlier days.  There are also clips of mini interviews with the people with whom he has worked, including Tony Roberts, Diane Keaton, Scarlett Johannsen, John Cusack, Owen Wilson, Mariel Hemingway, Gordon Willis, Marshall Brickmann, Martin Scorsese, his sister Letty Aronson, now his producer, Dick Cavett and so forth.  Although Mia Farrow is covered, she does not participate in any way since they have never resumed contact in any way. She was, of course, Allen's other major leading lady but he ended up having an affair and marrying her adopted daughter years ago.

Even though I have seen every single one of his movies, I really liked the choice of film clips presented here.  It was very enjoyable to see them and to learn some of the tidbits about what else was going on while making them.  Everyone contributed some major insight about the film clip which was unknown to us before.

I also enjoyed the way he present day took us to his old school or walked down the street with his sister and they talked to present New Yorkers.  There was even old footage shown of his parents who finally died near the century mark.

Although the focus was on the work, there was enough of a human dimension presented here to make this a very important summing up of a creative life while the creator is still around to share it.  If you love his work, you need this film in your collection.

I had never seen any ECW before buying this, but this is what I thought of it...
RVD V Jerry Lynn
This is a good match, although it takes a while to get started because of RVD taunting. When it does though, the match makes up for the slow start. There's a nice table spot and lots of chairs. 7/10
Awesome V Tanaka
The best match on the DVD. 2 tables break and lots of chairs are used! There are some good bumps and lots of high-flying moves too. I was surprised at how good this was. 8/10
Barbed wire Match Raven V Sandman
It's bloody, brutal and lots of tables break. It could have been better though, because it's quite clumsy (the last table brakes before the move actually happens). Also, it was paced a bit too slowly. 7/10
Dudleys V Spike & Balls
This was pretty good, but I expected more. Spike jumps off a high ladder at the start, which is cool. Also he gets put through a flaming table, which is pretty good. 7/10
Eliminators V Williams & Gordy
This match was only on the DVD for the end elbow drop. It is not really that high, especially as Perry sits down. Shane McMahon jumping of the Titantron at WWE Backlash 2001 was miles better. The rest of this match was crap and not worth watching making this a waste of space. 3/10
Sabu V Taz
This was very far off the ""most amazing grudge match ever"", but it was still cool. I thought it would be more hardcore actually, although there are some good spots. They use tables and chairs. 7/10
Dreamer & Beulah V Douglas & Francine
I don't know why this was on the DVD. Tommy gets hit with a chair by a fan, but that's about it. At least it's better than the Eliminators' tag match though. Why they made it the main event I don't know either. 4/10
Overall
There were no amazing matches here really, and some of the matches were actually quite crap. I've seen a lot better PPVs from WWE, and this was supposed to be a ""best of"" DVD!",0

Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"On the plus side, this movie serves up the most beautiful images of Italy. In fact, Italy is the star here. And I completely enjoyed all of the Italian actors who played smaller roles.  It's a pleasant, likeable, feel-good movie, and if that seems like damning with faint praise, that's because it is..  Very much a chick flick, which is not a put-down.  (And when did movies about relationships, feelings, romance come to be something to sneer at, anyway? )  There are no wizards here, no space aliens, no explosions, no threats to the future of the planet.  No violence at all.  The actors are all fine and Vanessa Redgrave is, as always, superb.  One exception is Christopher Egan, whose performance for most of the movie is over the top, which may be less inept acting than poor direction.

That being said, here's the downside:  It's going to remind you of a lightweight, made-for-tv romance of the type you can find on the Lifetime or Hallmark channel, just with a bigger budget.  The intrusive candy-pop music selections can't help but point you in that direction and make you think that perhaps it's targeted to junior high schoolers. I found myself wondering how Vanessa Redgrave had wandered into a piece of fluff like this.  The plot has more potential than substance as presented here and with each new development it's easy to predict what will happen next.  No real drama, yet no comedy either.  In fact, no tension, no suspense, no surprises, no energy or sizzle.  Which is why the best I can say about it is that it's okay.  Just okay.  But I would have been angry had I spent $10 or $12 to see it in a theater.

If you want to see a 'chick flick' that emotionally touches you, inspires you to think, has more than a passing impact, then I suggest you consider The Enchanted April or Mona Lisa Smile or the marvelous German film, Mostly Martha (the original, not the American remake).",0
