I confirmed my suspicions about the price when I went to a local Nike outlet, only to find it 30.00 cheaper.  Moreover, the sole wasn't cut in the same way of the original, i.e., in blocks intended to push apart to provide a natural shock impact.  Too narrow inside and out.  The sole outsole was wider in the original.  Maybe just buying the name here.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Bought for my 16 year old son who is very picky! He loves them. The strap across the top of the foot has a fabric backing that keeps it from rubbing or scratching like slides with the adjustable Velcro straps. He has a narrow foot and these slides fit him well so I'd buy a size up if you have a an average to wide foot. I expected the slim fit per other reviews and purchased his normal shoe size hoping they would be a hit!  Can't go wrong with an UA gift for boys of all ages!,0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"These are very cute, comfortable sandals. For some reason it's hard to find navy sandals. The way the straps across the foot fit they won't rub my toes at all, and I seem to have very picky feet. I was a little concerned about the top strap. I have a medium width foot and I had to buckle this strap on the tightest setting. At first this strap seemed slightly tight on one foot but eased up right away. I hope this strap doesn't stretch out too much! Hope to enjoy these sandals for a good amount of time.",0

Another review mentioned a smell, I too washed the top and smell gone!  I wear a US 16, bra 36 I, and usually an XXL top; I ordered this top in XXL.  Some other reviewers mentioned somewhat large fit.  So I did expect this top to be a bit large and it is a bit ""flowy"" but in a nice way.  I would describe this top as a t-shirt with a fun hem line.",0

Normally I have to try something on or be there to gauge the ability for it to fit correctly. Not with this companies items or this garment alone. Be honest with the chart and the item will come to you in a great fit. I've purchased a few of these... washed and wore several times and so far the garment has held up it's moneys worth.

The shoes fit well and are comfortable. The color and quality are good. Velcro adjusting straps along with the quick release buckle are a good combination and should last quite a long time since I won't have to work the Velcro fasteners every time I put them on.

Too early to tell if I'd recommend them but I don't anticipate any problems.",0

I loved the 4 toes as they were much easier to get in and out of than 5 toe shoes. After adjusting to some seams that gave me blisters I was still happy with them. Then, even though I was 90% of the time running on concrete and asphalt, I started to get holes between the toes. I sewed them, but the holes keep coming back.
The provider sent me the wrong size",0

I normally wear a 14 in ladies or xl-(I ordered a large) this fit perfectly and could even have gone a size smaller if comfortable with a tighter fit around the waste. The sleeves draped nicely but does have a wider arm hole-sports bra or tank will be a must as you can view side of bra when lifting arm.

The material is VERY thin. I'm okay with the thinness, just didn't expect them to be that thin. Also, the small size is way too big for me. The length is so long that they have to be folded 3 times just to keep from being under my shoes. And the crotch hangs very low. The waist line is quite large as well. Basically, I can't wear them as they fall off or get stepped on constantly.",0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,This umbrella was very difficult to open and then just as difficult to fold back down. It feels as if after a few openings and closings it will break because of having to forse it to open.  I will not close down to the original size therefore it is a strain to wrap the band around it when it is in the folded closed position.  It will not fit back into its case. Construction not much better than a $3.00 umbrella you can buy on any corner on a rainy day.  It is pretty but not worth it.,0

The entire top is one giant elastic cocoon - puts quite a bit of pressure on your foot. Unsure if she can even wear them. It's not looking promising.

I did so much research and BOTH dresses I ordered for an important Black Tie Gala are absurdly small around torso.

But TOO BIG in the chest and hip area. I looked at many many photos for this dress and am stunned how far it plunges.

It's very strange because I am a perfect hourglass (37-29-38) and this dress should have fit comfortably.

- Great for plantar fascitiis

CONs:
- Expensive
- Odd sizing. I normally wear a size 8 or size 8W. These were too long in the toe area, but too narrow and rubbed my little toes.
- The sole isn't as thick as I'd like

The only problem is that it has a little bit of a smell, but I'm sure letting it air out will help. You could always use febreeze or perfume to make it smell better. Not a deal breaker. You will want time to air out the smell, or you will need to spray it with air freshener or something.

So yes, my shoes are great, but it's frustrating I lost so much of the material running down the sides while I was spraying it.

Also, if you are larger up top, definitely go for the bigger size. The material is stretchy which is the only reason the dress fit. It is very nicely made material and look wise.

These are amazing. I got them just to have something to slip on to take the dog out. Then I just started wearing them all the time. Just used them in 13 degree weather with a few inches of snow with no socks. Worked great.
They look nice and seem to hold up against the snow and salt here in the north east of the US.

I'll probably buy another pair to use when I""m out because I hate shoe laces.

It is very nice looking, made of tough nylon material.  Stitching is tight and straight.  Zippers are quality and zipper tabs are large enough to grab easily.  It is not a smooth, effortless motion to maneuver the zipper tab around the corners, but it does get around the 90 degree corners without coming out of the track.

This modernize fanny pack met all my needs and more. There are three pockets on the side which I felt was very secured since I kept my phone in the inner pocket versus the outer pocket.

There is also small pocket in the front that is secured with a zipper and a bottom (I kept my cash there).

The shearling lining is very soft and very warm, however the top of the boot is floppy so a little bit of that harsh winter breeze sneaks in at the ankles. Overall the boot looks good on, and the opening is wide enough for socks and skinny jeans.

They do have a rugged sole that is good for walking in all kinds of weather. I have not worn them yet, but I have to say, I cannot personally see how the quilted fabric would be warmer than the material the shoe part is made of.

The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work.

I noticed other tennis enthusiasts had similar OR hats, but I was very pleased with mine and glad I purchased it online.  And it's a good thing the hat can be put into a washing machine because it did get a little dirty after three days of wear.

However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag.

This model comes with two bands, one black, one brown.  Since my original came with black, I had my husband change the band to the brown.  No special tools were necessary, though it was a little tricky to line up the holes, so I don't think it would be convenient to change the band often.  Stuhrling watches keep very good time with the advantage of not having to change batteries.

I have spent a lot of money on good brands and still have problems, so I am delighted that Haflinger has shoes I can wear outside the house.  I am a little worried about getting them wet, but I guess I'll deal with that when the time comes.  I will probably be buying another pair for outdoors again soon.  Best shoe I have found for all around comfort and support!",0

This is my sixth Tissot and has become my favorite. What stands out at first is it's stunning blue face. I can't help but stare at it just to take in all of its nuances. The bracelet has solid end links. It is a very comfortable to wear watch. Though it is a large case diameter, it ""wears"" very nicely. The bracelet is not clunky or heavy and is not cheap either. The chronograph pushers are screw in as is the crown. One thing that has impressed me thus far is its lume. It has a blueish lume that lasts throughout the night. The rotating bezel is solid and ratchets nicely. The sub second complication is also lumed which I find as a nice touch.

Additionally, they are great looking and seem to be very high quality--I am confident that they will last.  Also, I think the footbed is very comfortable and they seem to support my high arches just fine. I have both the patent black leather and the blue Cayman style.

I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who needs these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin straps and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachments that attached to hose..younger readers will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash.

I was a little afraid when I ordered this that the rose would sit up too high.  But is does not.  It is a very enjoyable ring to wear.

The Poet's Silver Rose Ring of Marcasite
Oh, there are some tales of those days of old
During the rush west in search for gold.
There was a rebellion
Led by Nevada women
To wear not gold but marcasite:
Beauty in what was of plenty seemed right.
The Poet wears a silver rose ring of marcasite;
Supporting this Nevada cause so right!

Since I have owned Rockport shoes before I gave it a shot.  The shoes are nice looking, comfortable and a good value.
I have been happy with the past Rockports that I have owned and expect no less from these.  The sole is a ridged design so it holds the ground and doesn't slip when walking as has happened with other rubber soled shoes I have owned.
Comfort is the word that is synonymous with the Rockport brand and these shoes are no exception.  They are nice to slip into and nicer to walk in.  The rubber sole has enough give to absorb some of the shock of walking but not enough to feel cheap or soft.
I have a wide foot and normally wear a 10.5.  I fit into an 11 in the Rockports so I suggest going up a half size.

Ariat is the only brand we, as a boot wearing family, ever buy. So, once we got the boots, which was lickety split, of course, with Amazon Prime, we had Vid try them on. They fit exactly the way they are intended. They fit as though your foot is poured into a boot mold. haha. Of course, if they fit correctly, they should be a bit tight the first few times, they weather slowly, and fit your foot, well, like a glove.

However this is one of those products that even if I didn't get a discount I would think it was a nice purchase. Just a heads up for style purpose. If you like the modern and slim fit than the sizing should be normal. I got my size and it fit just right. Not sure how it will come out after I wash it though.

I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal.

It is so small that it just makes one tie and comes undone easily (!), can't have that now, can we? After two washings, it is starting the unraveling at the sleeves. Not much, but it does make me think this will be ratty looking in a year or so. It is lightweight which is nice for Arizona but not the softest material I've experienced. I have just ordered a bathrobe from another company and with hope, it will be what I was looking for.

One year later update:

For the price, this is a poor product. This is a $15 bathrobe that is good for a year of daily, yet light use. The seams are just giving away. There are numerous fabric strands all over the robe. It never was very soft. If I had paid $15, I would've just figured I got what I paid for. Not so with this robe at $40. I guess I'm looking for another robe one year later...",0

I'm not affiliated with either the manufacturer or the seller of this product, and all comments are based upon my own personal experience with the item. Hopefully my review has helped you make a more informed purchasing decision.}

This is a nifty little compact umbrella, that has a solid, sturdy grip and a loop to keep it close (or to hang up when not in use). It's large enough to keep you dry in a downpour, but then folds up small for easy storage (fits easily into purse, backpack or briefcase). The little ""extra"" with this umbrella is that the fabric cover that you slide over the umbrella when not in use has an outside pocket containing a water-resistant tarp! This means you can protect yourself if having to sit on wet ground, or to cover larger items that don't fit under the umbrella. What a cool touch! I will be keeping this umbrella in my car.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"OK.  There are multiple, varying reviews on these boots.  Some people say that they are a little big, some say they're ridiculously big... IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER TIMBERLAND SHOES OR BOOTS, JUST ORDER ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER THAN THOSE.

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and require you to wear a half size smaller than normal.  Therefore, if you don't own any Timberlands, order these ONE AND A HALF sizes smaller than your normal shoe size.  Period.  I usually wear a 12.  In Timberlands I wear an 11.5 and in these I needed a 10.5 (yes, this is all ridiculous and I actually can't believe I'm writing all of this right now).

Summary:
Timberlands in general - minus a half your normal size.
THESE Timberlands - minus one and a half your normal size.

These boots are awesome, light, not clunky, soft feeling footbed, nice arch support, look great and I really like them. 4 stars instead of five for the ridiculously stupid sizing and forcing me to get involved.

The size small is just absolutely perfect. The dress is extremely gorgeous.  I'm 5 foot two and the height of it is just in the middle of my knee. So it really has it vintage look to it. So with all that said, what's my beef with it?  Well I purchased a burgundy which appears to be a beautiful raspberry on both my iPhone and iPad. And it actually truly is a very doll burgundy. Secondly I had expected a knit fabric and this is a broadcloth  type fabric, you know the type of men shirts are made out of but with lots of stretch to it. And I'm worried that the dye looks rather cheap, that it might wash out and look very very faded after only two or three washes.

I have flat feet, so I can't wear shoes which have a pronounced hump in the insole.  The insole of these shoes is nice and flat, which I love, but you may not like that.

The grip is nice, too; I walked on some spilled water on a tile floor and didn't feel any slippage.

I plan on buying another pair in a different color to back these ones up.  The only thing stopping a 5-star review is that there are some rough edges on the inside, which can make them uncomfortable when wearing sock-less.  However, I'm finding those rough edges are smoothing out the more I wear the shoes, so we'll see!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"This skirt is TINY & TIGHT. I'm talking SKIN-tight. For reference I'm 5'7 and 175 lbs I usually wear a size 10. I originally ordered a size XL (which according to the manufacturer is a size 14 - 16, which is WAY bigger than I ever wear). It was STILL TOO SMALL and insanely TIGHT. I ordered an XXL (which apparently is a size 18-20!!!!!) It's a bit looser around the waist, but still pretty tight the rest of the way down. Honestly - and surprisingly - this skirt is really probably most flattering on a smaller sized body - guess they don't call it a pencil skirt for no reason. I do think it's extremely cute though, despite it not being the best fit.

Two other things: you can absolutely see a panty-line. You can't see through all the way to the undies, but the line is quite obviously there.

Second, I ordered the ""coral"" color, which looks neon pink in the pictures, I was pleasantly surprised to find out when it arrived that it's actually not neon pink, but a very pretty baby-pink color. So, I have no idea what the actual ""pink"" shade looks like, since the coral color is actually a very pretty, light shade of pink....",0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,CG,"UPDATE 7/4/15: I wore three pair of the same pair in two different colors for a couple of hours.

I had to replace the ""gold"" ring with a new one, and now it's a little smaller in the size. The size is perfect, and it's very comfortable.

The bottom of the ring is very small, but the inside is very strong. I will say that if you wear it alone, it won't last long. It's very delicate, and it's very light weight. The color is very vibrant, and it looks quite nice on.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I am very short: 4'9"".  10 years ago, I could find pants and jeans that were short enough without more than the normal petite person's problem.  Then companies started to lengthen inseams.  I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are very clear about inseams and will sometimes hem for free.  When I tried on these jeans in the store on a lark and they actually fit with just a little extra length, I bought an extra pair off of amazon since I never know when this will happen again!  I have hips and thighs, and these jeans are not too tight BUT the waist is tight enough without gapping.  Amazing!  A jean that made by someone who understands that there is a shape and size in between beanpole and barrel!  I was so impressed I tried buying a different petite style in the same brand, but although the shape was nice in those, there is an extra 2 inches of length that will need to be hemmed.  Sooo, I'm not convinced this brand understands that petite people are short, but for this one product, I am happy!",0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,CG,"I really love these scrub pants. They are very comfortable and they are also very comfortable. They are a little too tight around the waist.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I've been very pleased with these leggings. I'm 5'11"" and usually a L/XL size that says it will fit me, does not.  I was very impressed that these DID fit. They ended about 3 inches above my ankles, but could be pulled lower, resulting in a thinner, stretched legging.
 I was also impressed with how versatile the sizing can be for these because of the elastic waistband and stretchy fleece. These are true to the claim that they do not contain a seam.  The inside is a very soft, low pile fleece material. The outside is smoother, not furry.  The elastic waistband is incorporated INTO the fabric, so the waist is VERY comfortable and not bulky at all. These keep my legs warm in the winter and pair nicely with a boot.
I have noticed that when something rubs against them in the same place over and over, they can get little fuzz balls. They also attract animal hair like crazy. If you have pets you will probably become frustrated with this. However, I've noticed that this is common with ALL fleece leggings so I am not removing a star for it - only letting other customer's know what to expect.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another.",0

His feet were always squishing in cotton socks and his socks were nasty in the laundry.  He insisted on his thick cotton Thorlo socks because they had padding where he liked it for long runs.  Finally!  I came across this moisture wicking Thorlo sock that has most of the same padding especially in the bottom areas.  He put them on after a race.  Now, let me tell you after a race, he is sweating so much he looks like he just stepped out of a shower.  Amazingly, his feet remained dry even though he was soaking wet everywhere else.  Afterwards, these socks did not pollute the laundry basket like the soaked cotton socks.  His only concern is they don't have quite as much padding on the top of the sock as his other cotton Thorlos so they may not be good for running down hills, but we don't have a lot of hills where we live.  So that isn't a problem unless we start travelling to running races again.",0

I'm a woman, and was looking for a small, lightweight messenger style bag that would fit my wallet, keys, phone & other small necessities as well as my iPad, pencil, battery charger, cords... Etc. I wanted something sturdy, simple and well designed, but that appealed to my style. This bag met all my requirements and I've been really impressed by the quality and craftsmanship. I'm surprised at how roomy it is for what I feel is a smaller bag - even loaded up with all my stuff, I've always had room to spare.
During shipping, the box was slightly damaged and the bottom front corner of the bag was dented when I unpacked it. I decided to keep it, hoping with use it would work itself out with use, but it didn't and the dent remains. It adds character... That's what I'm going with :)
The only other thing I would wish for is an extra metal slide or something to keep the loops of the long strap together. When I shorten the strap, the strap doubles across itself and doesn't function well as a single strap when I go to grab it quickly... Just a minor thing really.

I gave them to my daughter for her birthday and she LOVES them (well, love may not be strong enough of a word here...).

They are platinum plated, sterling silver so they won't turn your skin green like the fake stuff usually does. They stay affixed like they ought to and more importantly, they LOOK like diamonds. A friend of mine is a precious metals independent worker who once told me that in all honesty, a GOOD CZ stone is virtually impossible to see with the naked eye, and many have a hard time seeing the difference even with help (I don't work in the industry, so I cannot verify that any of this is true--but I DO trust my friend, if that means anything).

They're comfortable, though, and will serve as a basic fitness shoe. Moreover, they are fashionable. They always look classy, and this is a style that I don't think will ever really go out of style.

The best part is that they're priced in such a way that I don't feel terrible about replacing them once a year. I blow through a pair of these in about a year, but Amazon usually has one or more colors of them available for a really reasonable price point. This time I went with an all-black style, but I also have some green ones. It's a lot like wearing the converse all stars, but you get a lot more support for your foot. You can buy a bunch of these in different colors, if you want to have fashionable colorful sneakers but you don't want to develop foot and back pain.

And let's face it, by the way -- if you're walking around all the time, doing errands and exercise, and all that sort of thing, most sneakers are going to wear out pretty quickly. At least these are lightweight, comfortable, and fashionable -- and they don't break the bank!",0

Tungsten is a very hard and dense metal.  From the research that I have found, tungsten is ten times harder than 18k gold and four times harder than titanium and twice as hard as steel.

With socks on, the foot fits well around the arch, ankle, & heel (my mother, who has very high arches, did not find the arch as comfortable). The toe is roomy, but I like that. The ankle feels likes it's reinforced, so if you try to bend your ankle too much, it might feel weird, but that's true for many boots. If you walk placing one foot in front of the other (like you would if wearing dress shoes or on a runway at a fashion show), then the clips on the interior side of the calves are going to knock into each other and will likely come undone -- other comments have mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your feet slightly apart, it's not a problem at all. The clips are not so large as to knock into each other if you make just slight adjustment to your foot placement.  After all, they're made for stomping around in rain and mud, not to be worn as dress shoes or at runway shows, even though they are cute enough for that. ;)  Overall, I like them and would recommend them.",0

The zippers move freely and once opened the case has compartments on both sides. The left side is your standard open suitcase compartment with straps to hold down clothes and a small zippered compartment on the side. The right side zips all the way around to cover clothes packed on that side then in addition the zipper top has 3 additional pockets, 1 zippered and two open sided, built into that cover. This will allow me to pack my toiletries without adding the bulk of a toiletry case. The bag also features a built in TSA approved lock which locks down the zipper pulls keeping your items secure yet accessible to TSA inspection. The four wheels allow for easy movement on both tile and carpet.

The only thing keeping me from rating this a perfect 5 stars is the fact that just opening and exploring the case with it the sides open onto ceramic tile caused slight scratching on the small popout logo in the front of the case.

There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I love PattyBoutik but I am on the fence on this one. I usually wear a S or M in most brands of shirts and for this shirt the small for this top fit perfect on me. I am 5'3"" at around 145lbs. I wanted something to cover my tummy area, but I'm torn because on one hand it fits great but on the other I worry it's too puffy looking in the front. My biggest fear though is with this color that sweat will easily show so I haven't worn it to photograph any hot weather weddings, which is why I bought it. The other thing is I feel like I need to tan with this color. It blends in with my skin tone so much that it looks nude on me and I'm so pail that I wish I got a different color. So all in all I may just wear this one around the house. BUT that has nothing to do with the product itself!  This fabric of this shirt feels so soft on the skin and washes nicely. I got it right away, shipping is fast and reliable. Wrapped up nicely makes you feel like it's a present! :) Will be buying more in the future regardless and other styles.

The top strap is wide but flattering and also a tinge on the shorter side.  I am wearing on the last hole so that it is not tight and uncomfortable.  I will most likely go down a notch once a little stretched to my foot.  The heel is the biggest consideration.  While I can wear them the whole day they are not totally comfortable the whole whole day.  The ball of my foot does feel some pressure as there is not a lot of padding or cushion. The heel is on the higher side of a wedge but again looks very attractive.  The material of the shoe is a suede like fabric and flexible, not stiff.  The only other issue I had was some rubbing of my baby toe which is not a defect of the shoe.  I think once warn a few more times and broken in they will be pretty good.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I am a long time Skechers shoe wearer for two reasons: 1. I have worn them for fifteen years and 2. I need a wide shoe, which Skechers has always had, which is why I have worn them for fifteen years.

The pilot is one of my go-to boots. I wear the hell out of them and buy a new pair every other year depending on what I put them through. I wear them for dress, for work, for hiking, for fishing. They hold up very well, always look good, and are always comfortable.

The biggest reason I wear them is that I can trust the size. I wear a 13 EE and over the years the fit has always been true. That's a huge relief since buying a good, wide, boot or show is a serious PITA.

The boots are not without their short comings but these are, relative to the price, minor things. The shoe-lace metalic tabs get lose eventually and bend and require a pair of pliers to bend back and keep in place. But, like I said, this is a minor thing.

And, like I said, I do beat up on these boots pretty bad. But the heel always wears well, never breaks or falls apart, the leather holds up great and the comfort stays until I buy a new pair.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"These fit well. They tuck well. They definitely make hot weather easier to manage if you wear multiple layers.
My two complaints:
1) The collar is sized in a manner that often you are left feeling the tag of your outer shirt on your neck, which can be annoying, especially if you are wearing sunscreen. Sometimes this collar will ""roll up"" too. I assume this is from the type of material used.
2) Due to the material of the shirt, your outer shirt tends to come untucked, ballooning much sooner into your work day. This, again, is likely due to the material of the shirt, as there is minimal friction between the undershirt and the outer shirt. This untucking is exacerbated if your outer shirt happens to be moisture wicking (low friction at the underside, usually).
While I really do appreciate what these shirts do, I cannot imagine spending the same amount of money on another two. If the price was a bit less, then yes. However, for the money, there are a plethora of other brands that have extremely similar materials (literally two sides of the same coin at this juncture of clothing technology), that likely perform just as well. Since it is an undershirt, how much does brand really matter? IF brand does matter to you, then know these do what they advertise, but come with a few caveats.",0

I was a little unsure about the sizing based on the chart but I am 5'6 and 160 lbs and a medium fits me fine. The fleece is high quality and slightly stiff, it feels almost like a wool. The stiffness will help the cape keep it's shape over time. And the collar comes up slightly in the back of the next which gives it a little flair and elegance, especially when your hair is pinned up! It is very high quality and the arm holes are in exactly the right place and provide a good range of movement. The snaps on the front are very sturdy and hidden when the cape is completely closed, no buttons or zips to ruin the sleek, simple style.

My feet never tire in them. I used to wear different brands all of the time, but I don't see any need to shop around for comfort since I found Cushe. There are enough styles to cover many looks.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Although these can hardly be called ""shorties"" -- they hit mid-thigh -- they are definitely comfortable ""smoothers.""  I can wear mine all day, and I only occasionally remember that I'm wearing them.  A medium fits a pants size 8-10.

I was a little surprised to see how sheer these are, without any seams at the bottom.  But the lack of hem is a great idea since no one can see the line where the shapewear ends.  (If you buy too small, you might see a difference between the compressed area and your thigh.)  Because they are so sheer, the amount of control is light, but the smoothing factor is strong.  Especially under tight or stretchy pants, these smooth out bumps nicely.  Yeah, they don't work miracles, but they can make your body look sleeker than it is.

I'm always concerned that shapewear, particularly the kind that targets thighs, will ride up.  On a full, 16-hour day of wearing the shorty shapewear,  this might happen two or three times at most, and it's never so bad that it's uncomfortable or visible.  I never feel the pinch at my waist that I had with another brand that I tried.  Perhaps because these offer moderate control -- as opposed to full-on squeezing -- they are the most comfortable shapewear I've worn.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"So I ordered without really paying attention to details. Keep in mind that although the some people say it rolls, it really depends on how you apply it! I'm 5'5 147lbs. I'm not chubs, slimmer side BUT with a tummy apparently..I wish it was gone but oh well. Now I got a medium..the torso part goes all the way to my under boobs. I haven't tried making it go higher. But I can say my thighs and stomach feel tighter. It also lifts your butt, which is a plus! Give it a try. You can't tell you're wearing it and it doesn't cause pain when breathing.

Cons: it's tight, not as tight from the stomach as I would like. I did read some reviewers left this comment as well. It doesn't hurt from the torso as others do. The glue type of plastic in the back line helps it adhere to your skin so it doesn't roll.

Pros: I thought the material would be thicker. But nope, they feel like nylons! A bit tighter than nylons. Be careful when pulling it, you can rip it. I haven't ripped mine so we're good.

BIGGEST Q&A:

They are about mid-rise, with wide waistband. You could pull it down for a lower rise pant. I haven't actually worn them, I know people say drawstring is decorative only.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"First off, I have to say I made a mistake buying this, not carefully checking the size; it's too small for me. Not so much so that I can't use it, so I'll keep it, but I would have passed on it had I realized how much smaller than my prior bag this is.

On the positive side, this is made of a sturdy canvas that I expect will hold up well. It has plenty of pockets: an external velcro-sealed pocket on either end (a bit small for my glasses case); a large internal compartment; and, within that, a zippered internal pocket. There are three pockets outside the main compartment under the flap, two sealable with velcro. These can be used for small items such as a cell-phone or calculator.

On the downside, the main compartment lacks any zipper or other fastener, so items can come tumbling out. The side pockets are a bit small, and one of the three pockets under the flap also lacks a closure.  Also, the strap is not long enough for my needs. I'm fairly tall and I like the bag to come down to my hip. This bag rides too high and feels a bit odd when I wear it. These are minor complaints, however, so I only deducted one star.

She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long.

There were a significant number of complaints regarding the sizing of the shoes. 100% of the complaints were about over sizing issues. I normally wear a size 12 wide. But after reading the reviews and of course checking the sizing chart; I came to the conclusion that I would go with A size 11 1/2 m. With standard shipping (free) The shoes arrived in a timely manner. When I popped the shoes out of the box, I found a beautiful brown soft leather shoe. Now, I would not describe the shoe as a hightops or mids and of course they're not flip-flops. But the glove leather that does fit around your foot is just high enough that one would be only marginally wrong in calling them sandals. When I placed the shoes on my feet the length was perfect but the width was a different story. The width of the shoe on my left foot was dead-bang, whereas the right foot felt like it was in a vise grip. There was absolutely no problem with returning them.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I have had quite a history with wearing jeans - there was a phase when I could pass off as a bum, and then another phase when I could pass as a bloated stick figure - and sadly each of those phases (and others in between) have been immortalized in my family photographs.
When I opened the box for these and put them on, however, it was like I had finally met my soulmate.

The 514 has been variously labeled as a straight fit or a slim straight fit. I believe this should be correctly labeled as a slim straight fit. However it is nowhere close to being skinny. In my opinion these are best suited for my body type (I am 180cm and 178lbs - with relatively slimmer legs). They hug the thighs just so correctly and do not feel baggy.

They look equally great with moccasins and sneakers - though hang a little loose at the end with my dress shoes. I haven't had a chance to wear them with boots - but I think they would do okay with boots as well (I do not like bootcuts).

The Dirt Rush color is very neutral - a little bit lighter than it appears in the photograph (not necessarily a bad thing) - and looks more greenish in sunlight - however very subdued.

Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight.

I am so hooked on these boxer briefs. It was one of my best buys of 2014. I now have 9 pair, and if had the extra cash. I would buy 9 more pair. I took a chance on these & struck gold..... I am not one to get attached to my underwear, but these are the most comfortable I have owned in all my 63 yrs. of life. If I can, I will replace all my underwear with these. I should have bought more. They fit perfect in the pouch, and the comfort is top shelf for the money. Go ahead, go out and spend $20.00 a pair for underwear. I think that is rediculous  for underwear. After you wash them, they fit even better. Cannot be beaten for the money. Like I said, go a size larger. My extra large are perfect. I am 6'1"" & 210 lbs.

I cannot understand why their are any negative view points on this product. I too, took a chance on these Boxer Briefs, and like I said, I have 9 pair!. These could possibly sell much higher.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I have several pairs of Timberland boots and love them all. This pair is no exception. Great quality. Sturdy and durable. Cute and versatile. The only difference that sticks out is that it isn't as comfortable as my other pairs. It's kind of stiff all around (including the foot bed), but perhaps that'll change with more use. It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in.",0

I am 5'3 and 140 with a 40D bust and normally wear a L but went with the XL because I saw mixed reviews on how it fit. A L would have fit  fine but the XL works too as this is meant to be loose and drape. This fits perfect in the bust with a nice V neckline. The straps are adjustable and the comes up to the armpits so you don't have to worry about you bra showing and if you have a little extra chunk where your chest and armpit meet, this covers it nicely. this is very flowy and has a beautiful irregular hemline. The drape effect comes from extra material on the sides so if you spread it out it looks like batwings. The material is soft and stretchy, but you won't need any extra stretch. It is tapered just right to show off your curves and flatters any shape.  The shortest parts comes just above my knees and longest just below. I would recommend a lint roller. I will be purchasing more in other colors. Perfect for a hot day when you want to be cool, stylish, and comfortable and all for the right price!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"No issue with the merchant - ClothingShopOnline shipped the item promptly and it was clearly brand-new - but I buy these extra-huge sizes to allow for the inevitable shrinkage in the wash.  I'm not a massive guy, just taller than most...and my goal is to start out with something closer to the size of a tent, and end up with something that fits after it's been washed.  So I tried this XXXL sweatshirt on and while it was good and roomy and baggy (as expected, remember, I want that extra room so that when it shrinks it'll be fine), the sleeves were just a hair longer than what would have been expected from an XL.  So right now, unwashed and right out of the box, the sleeve length is basically perfect.  Which means, once washed, these sleeves will be far too short.  Actually, I bet these *are* sleeves for an XL shirt; the seam at the shoulder is almost down to my bicep, meaning they added material in the torso area but not in the sleeves.  I have to laugh - what kind of individual must the manufacturer have been envisioning when determining what XXXL should be?  Maybe a three-foot-tall troll with little nubs for arms?  I'll probably keep it and just wash it in cold (and air dry it)...since the weight is nice and it seems to be of decent enough quality.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This has to be one of the best designed and most comfortable bras I have ever worn! As a size 36DD woman, it is very hard to find something that not only has good support, but is feminine and pretty too. This bra designer understands the needs of a heavily busted woman. First of all, they give you an extra hook and eye bra strap extender to allow your bra to fit perfectly throughout a little weight gain or weight loss. No back fat is going to be created by this band not fitting well. The straps are softly padded over the shoulders, so nothing digs in leaving those red strap marks on your shoulders at the end of the day. The underwire supported cups of the bra give full coverage and also great support holding everything at the right height and in place. They are lightly lined for comfort and concealment and the lace and bow accents are very feminine. Nothing shows through your clothing ~ even the lace overlay on the cups. I believe for me this was a perfect fit - it did not run too large or too small. I would certainly love to have a drawer full of these bras, as I personally could not ask for anything better made, more reasonable priced or with a better fit than this bra.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I received this belt and I had to return it right away. The Seller did not object, and kindly offered to pay for shipping costs involved. NOTHING was wrong or objectionable with the belt, but despite my efforts to compare my shoes which I placed next to three different computer screens, the color did not match the pair of shoes that I wanted this belt to match.

The reason for this review is because of an issue that I consider of great importance. It is about the Buckle.

Other Sellers offer Ratchet Belts with not only an exceedingly heavy buckle but their buckles have a visible layer of paint. An unacceptable condition occurs when ~in the restroom~ one pulls slacks down. The heavy buckle will drag on the floor, and after several trips to the restroom, approximately half of the painted area has no paint any more. It looks ugly !

This Seller offers the exact same belts with a reliable Ratchet Mechanism and very nice looking leather; but...

Difference #1: the buckle accurately replicate the appealing look of a conventional buckle used for centuries.
Difference #2: there is no paint to scratch.
Difference #3: the buckle is lighter.

BOTTOM LINE - If you guys out there do not want to invest some good money in a belt that everyone notices it is all scratched out and looks ugly just days after you start wearing it, then, this Seller's has resolved that issue brilliantly.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?

My problem was my usual brand has been lacking in quality as of late. for the past 3 years, I was going through them very quickly.

So I decided to give Carhartt a try. I have recently switch to their jeans because of quality dropping in my usual brand and style so I decided to give these a try. They are strongly constructed and look good. Not as much room in the seat and thigh area as I would like but I'm getting used to it. Have been washed a few times and the color has not faded.

Some are saying that they feel rough and stiff. Well, yeah. Compared to my previous brand (which I will probably by for casual occasions and not need to was as frequently), these aren't very soft. But I was going for durable. While I work in an office, I do have to do some physical stuff. May I suggest using a liquid fabric softener. I always use it and have no problem with these pants.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"POk - Thorough-but-to-the-point review bc these are $$ and purposeful (warmth/tread/hiking).

VERDICT: GREAT BOOTS.

Size:
Runs one size small, as many said (I wear a 5 and have NEVER tried on a shoe I could not fit into! Lol.)  I didn't take off a star for it bc it's warned about enough on here to know.

Height:
At a short-legged 5'4"", they ended @ 1.5"" below the knee (so not as curiously high as as many found). HOWEVER, bigger size, bigger proportions. My 5s surely run a inch shorter than a 10 would.

Fit:
Slightly narrow, but leather stretches/adjusts to your foot, so... Not much breaking in for me.

Quality/Warmth:
Leather is soft and nice.
Lining is ideal and warm.
The top studs actually keep the laces in place (I rarely see that!) contoured and supported my foot well (nothing spectacular either if you have special needs there) a just average).
Can't attest to durability bc they're new.
And, of course, the laces provide complete adjustment to your own foot, while the side zipper lets you keep it that way (and makes the on/off process quick and easy.) What a concept! Never thought it would be so hard finding a lace/zip winter boot.

There is a slippery finish on the soles that i was sliding all all over the place. I think (HOPE!!!!) it rubs off as you wear it. Still - makes you wonder and have to use it beyond return to know, and you can't evaluate the real tread before committing.  Not cool. Lost a star.",0

In addition, I'm taking a sightseeing trip this summer and will be on my feet at least 12 hours a day.  These boots completely fit the bill.

They are attractive enough that they look great with jeans or khakis.  They look especially cute with white socks and walking shorts.  They are not too clunky, they look like brown sneakers/shoes.  They were so comfy from the moment I put them on, that no breaking in period was required.  I stomped through the mud and water and my socks stayed nice and dry.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

If I cant trust it, it doesnt fly with me. I expected better for the price.",0

I ended up buying these cheater plugs because I needed a pair of earrings that I can wear daily and won't poke me in the neck or fall out because of a cheap backing. These earrings fit all of my requirements; they have a nice screw-on back and they are identical front and back so no more neck poking. These cheaters do look like the real thing as well. They fit well and I forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable. These are made of surgical steel and feel very well made and seem as though they will hold up well over daily use.

It is important to note that the posts on these are larger than the average stud post so you may have to work to get them in the first time around. Normal earring posts are usually 18g these are 16g.

Edit: After being so pleased with these cheaters I went ahead and purchase this same style in the other colors (black, purple, blue, green and the plain silver ones) I love all of them just as much as my this rose gold one. The colors are all true to the pictures and they all are well made. One thing I should mention is the plain silver pair has a slightly longer post than the rest but it doesn't really bother me.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,"Revised review Dec. 2015:  I finally gave up on these and put them on Ebay!  Impossible boots.  Hard as a rock, NEVER got soft, even after mink oiling, baking, stretching... they were more like torture devices than shoes.  Could not wear them long enough to even begin to break them in, if I walked more than 2 minutes, I got enormous blisters on my heels.  Too much pain for the price!!  A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again.

--------------

I dithered for months before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots.  Can't say I love them...yet.  Well made, but for me the styling is a little off.  The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I was looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot.  Had them stretched for both length and width.  And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, makes a slapping noise when you walk - !!  Which I personally don't care for.  I guess I was expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread.  These are almost like riding boots.  Have not even worn them enough to break them in.  Honestly, the $60 Steve Maddens (discontinued, alas!) are more comfortable and more to my liking.  I will come back to these in the fall and see if I can make them work.  Quality-wise, they're great, so no problem there.",0

The sole is a little stiff, but I feel like the shoe will last. The color is nice, but it isn't exactly the brown color I was looking for.",1
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I was kind of hoping these would replace my current brown everyday work shoes (Doc Martin-looking Sketchers oxfords).  They do seem comfy enough to fill that purpose, but I don't think they're the sort of shoe to wear outside in any kind of winter weather.  More of a spring/fall shoe.  They're just not that substantial -- either the sole or upper.  The leather is super soft, broken in unlike any shoe I've ever seen and kind of thin-- sort of like kid leather.  This makes them very comfy, but not like anything I'd want to step in a slushy puddle in, plus I don't think they'll be very warm at all.  I deemed them to ""fit as expected"" because as a 7.5, the 8s were a little big on me.  Don't know why they couldn't manage half sizes.  They seem to run a bit narrow, also, but they are so soft and pliable I have no doubt they'll stretch out easily if your foot isn't excessively wide (mine is a tad wide).  At any rate, they seem well worth the bargain price I paid ($25, I think), so I will keep them.
Update:  I should also emphasize that the soles aren't very supportive.  They sort of have a ""barefoot"" feel like 5-toe shoes or minimal running shoes -- not a bad thing at all, but might not work for some.  You might say they are like a moccasin dressed up as an oxford.",0

Attached labels & Instructions are provided on how to reset the generic 000 lock code. This luggage genuinely exceeds my expectations. I first seen the Non-Prime HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage set on Amazon and the 4 differences were it had a (1) matte finish, (2) Luggage front had the Company name on a silver metal plate (classy touch) & 3rd-it was priced approximately $70.00 more (or so). My main concern was the company didn't guarantee the 2 day shipping. However, this set is gorgeous, featuring expander zippers, 360 spinner wheels that keep spinning (quietly), zipper pockets/compartment on the L side & an elastic X strap securing the (R) compartment  for larger items. The handles flow easily up and down & the set is easy to maneuver, but still feels sturdy. I purchased Amazon fabric packing cubes in the same color pattern, White mesh with a Black zipper.

It works better looped around the band and then slid the bands down your finger around the area the ring will sit, make sure the looped area on the ring is turned towards your palm side and then stretch the bands a bit to get you ring on and slide into place.

I don't know why, but my family has a lot of fun with masks and costumes, well past their typical use day and age suggestions. So I knew that we'd have fun with this one. I chose the pug because........... um, it's a pug?!? A pug face on a dog body is cute/funny enough. A pug face on a human body is hysterical.

This mask is rubber and fits a variety of head shapes and hair styles. It does have a funky smell as a lot of rubber masks do, but once it's aired out a bit, it's not even noticeable. The eye holes are actually near the snout, rather than the actual eyes, so it gives it a little more of a realistic look. The only thing I'd change is the mouth opening. If the person wearing it smiles and their teeth show it's super freaky. We're using this as a quick costume when needed, to make funny videos, to wear while riding the bike (why not - it really makes people look twice). Sometimes I wear it in the car (as a passenger, never while driving). Basically, doing anything you can think of that would look funnier if a person with a pug head was doing it.

It came in a nice blue box, like others have said, the stickers do not remove easily for re-use, but you could always put your own sticker over it if you wanted to re-use the box.

Inside the box was a black suede drawstring pouch sitting atop the foamy padding in generally find in jewelry packing.

As for the bracelet itself, it's beautiful.  My 18 yr daughter loves it, so I imagine I'll be sharing.

It feels rather luxurious to be wearing all of these pearls, which are intertwined with a dark brown string and crystals.  The crystals have a great sparkle to them which adds an element of bling to the pearls.  The pearls are large in size, and definitely potato shaped.

The pearls do have markings on them which do appear to be from tools, many of the pearls are unmarked though and I don't feel like it distracts from the beauty.

As for the brown cord, it clearly shows the brown cord in the photos, so it's to be expected and I don't mind it one bit.

The size of the bracelet is a bit on the small size.  I am smaller boned and don't have tiny wrists, but they are probably smaller than average and I feel most comfortable using the extender when clasping the bracelet together.

I have a large watch collection, including many dive watches - some at price points between $1K-2K.  Still, I am very impressed with what Bulova has done with this 300m Sea King!  The dial is simple, extremely legible, and beautiful.  The orange highlights look great against the black dial.  And the smooth sweeping second hand is a cool sight to behold.  It is smoother than the second hand on virtually any automatic watch.  The top of the bezel is brushed, and looks REALLY nice.  It has a usable lume pip at the 12:00 position, and the dial lume is pretty good also.  The rest of the case has brushed and polished bits, making for a very nice overall look.  The case is relatively large, at about 49mm diameter (not including crown).  Even the rubber strap is pretty nice for a $200 watch!  The case back even has a cool little logo on it.

The accuracy of these Bulova 262kHz watches is superb!!  You will only find equal or better accuracy in watches that are radio or satellite controlled - and many of those are much more expensive than this one.

Reebok DMX Foam is a soft and responsive foam compound used to deliver long-lasting cushioning. The focus is to deliver cushioning in the areas players need it most at the ideal time. In the footbed area, DMX Foam is soft and cushioned for high levels of comfort. Meanwhile, closer to the ground, DMX Foam is sturdier and more responsive to provide shock absorption as feet hit the ground.

I think I will be sticking with Reebok in the future because of their consistancy. My Reebok sneakes have lasted me about 9 months on average with everyday wear though. I have gotten as much as a year of wear out of some of them but that was pushing it a bit.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1,OR,"This dres arrived dirty and extremely wrinkled, I know for a fact this item was returned by a previous owner or it was used on some kind of display. I received the dress the day before I needed it for my daughter so I could not return it in time to get another one. It had brown make up on parts of the dress, which I had to clean with make up remover and baby wipes.

The dress was extrely wrinkled due to the fact that the dress was STUFFED back into it's packaging. So I had to give it a good steaming job before it even stared to look decent. The same previous owner must have reinforced the flower appliques on the dress with a hot glue gun because there were dried glue strings hanging from the flowers.

The quality of the dress: it was ok considering that it is a child's play dress. Compared to other children at my daughter's school who also wore princess dresses, this one held up a day of playing, running, swinging, rolling of the ground/grass much better than the others.

My daughter did not complain of anything being itchy on the inside, which I was thankful for. I say that because the tulle fabric overlay on the outside is very stiff, as if it was treated/sprayed with a fabric stiffener or something.

The back of the dress has a little circle velcro closure piece that does not stick very well.

The dress does comes with the  crown that you see in the pictures...but it does not come with a wand though.",0

We are taking then on a long train ride from NY to San Diego with stops in Grand Canyon, lots of kid things in San Diego. I am a travel nanny by trade so being prepared is my motto!  They needed backpacks just big enough to carry a couple bottles of water an a good supply of snacks for hikes and carry their Fire for train rides. I thought this was going to be too small at first. But I easily put a bottle on outside and inside plus my Fire and plenty of room for snacks, some playing cards etc. The back has a small padded feature. I wondered if straps would fit 7 yr old and I can adjust to even fit me! Best part? So light even with stuff that even my 5 year old won't complain! The stretchy from cords can even carry a small stuffed animal for sleep later.

I will do an update after trip (if still alive) and give feedbacks. With kids, go as small as you can and still do the job!

Update: These were perfect and now after trip they use it on long bike rides with dad.

I liked it so much that I got one for myself for my Scotland trip in Oct. I can not do heavy backpacks and when out being a tourist, purses are a bother. Great for plane as will hold a travel blanket, fire and tablet, phone and cords plus a bottle.

They usually are longer and even though I got a size one of thissuper comfy stretch denim five pocket jeans it is still a little big on me especially on the hip and back side maybe because I am not that gifted on that part.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"This is my third pair of Dickies brand work pants. Two of the three pairs - in different styles, have similar problems.

I'm about 5'7"", 125 lbs and the size 4 is the right size for me. Unfortunately, in Dickies' carpenter style, the waist is higher and wider than their cargo workpant style. I have wide hips and a small waist, so after purchasing a pair of the cargo pants and liking the style and fit, I was disappointed when I tried these on. These pants ride higher and looser in the waist than other Dickies.

Other reviewers have stated how rugged the material is. I would add the caveat that it's rugged--by Women's clothing standards. This isn't fashion attire, but it isn't the heavy duck cloth typical in many Men's work pants, either. I can't speak to the working conditions of other people, but I work in a factory alongside men and the work I perform puts the same strains on my clothes - it would be nice if my clothes could last as long. These pants are new, so we'll see.

These pants had frayed seams right out of the bag. I examined the seams closely, and it appears to be cosmetic (the fringe of the under-layer of fabric didn't lay quite right when the crotch seams were stitched) - not structural. As this is the second pair I've gotten with seam problems, I'd say Dickies has a quality control problem.

Pros:
Good quality materials
Good length and style
Rear pockets big enough for my wallet

Cons:
Material could be more rugged
Inconsistent sizing across styles
Poor assembly at seams - fraying sewn in at crotch",0

I was very happy to receive this as a gift from my husband (who is terrible at picking out jewelry. this was on the short list that I sent him so he could ""surprise"" me in pre-approved fashion. ) :)) Of course it's lightweight, as some reviewers have noted--a completely solid (filled) 14k gold bracelet would cost a fortune!!!! Most gold jewelry these days is hollow, to reduce cost. For me this is great, because I can't stand heavy jewelry, so this is just like my other Duragold bangles. very light and very comfortable to wear all day long. I've had it for about 3 months now, maybe 4, I wear it almost every day with other jewelry, and see no dents or dings (people who complain about 14k jewelry sustaining dents might want to remember that all 14k jewelry is somewhat soft and prone to dents with heavy or careless use). Additionally, the etching is doing a great job of hiding any scratches it might have sustained. So if you ""play rough"" or regularly tend to, for example, run into walls (??) gold jewelry might not be ideal for you. If you play nice, this is a great bangle, looks very sparkly with the diamond etching, and has a lovely sturdy clasp and a great shape. You won't want to take it off. If you have questions about size, a sizing chart is provided above, and it's very easy to convert millimeters into inches using the Internet. or a ruler. or math. :) 10 mm equals 1 cm. 2. 5 cm equals 1 inch.

This is not a watch for everyday use. This is for sportsmen, to be strapped atop bulky clothing. The watch feels very strong and rugged, good for rough sports activity. Were I to see a man wearing this watch at a formal function, I'd think he was ""trying too hard"" to impress, wearing such a gaudy (albeit attractive) timepiece.

I've read that watches are declining in sales, because so many people now rely on their smart phones to know the time. Watches are increasingly being used as jewelry, or to make a statement. This watch is certainly eye-catching. But this watch is also useful if you're wrapped in bulky sports clothes, and don't want to fumble for the smart phone in your pocket.

Plus, this watch has a second hand. My smart phone provides no way for me to measure the passing of seconds. So this watch also serves as a stop watch.

My watch came with the WRONG MANUAL. It came in a nice box, with a nice paper manual. But the watch described in the manual is not the one that came in the box. My watch's face and features are entirely different from the diagrams of the watch in the manual. For instance, my watch only has a second hand, not the 1/10 of a second hand pictured in the manual.

My daughter is 15 months old, 25 pounds and has chubby thighs.
I read many of the reviews saying that this item runs a bit large.  I purchased two sizes since Amazon offers free returns on this item, thinking I would try them on and keep one.

My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothing.

I purchased two sizes: 18 months and the 2T.

The 18 month size fits her perfectly.  It's not too tight, there is room to grow in both the top and bottom.
The top is cut nice and long, so the bottom of the top sits at on her lower hips.  On my daughter, the hem of the top covers the waist of the bottoms, this helps the top from riding up.
The bottoms fit nicely over swim diapers.

We have used this both at the pool and the spray ground (I have included photos, front and back).
The quality (we have had these for one week) look to be great, the zipper is sturdy and very easy to zip up and down.  I do love how easy it is to get on and off.  One other reviewer did not like the bulk of the zipper, and I can see if the the child is wearing a size that is too large, then the top might ride up and the zipper might be bulky, but we don't have this problem.

I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Large Canvas Duffel

Purchased to store my 7.5' full Christmas tree with lights.  The bag worked well; handles are sturdy and there are enough of them sewn around the bag they are actually useful.  The bag is now hanging by one of those handles with no issues of tearing, ripping, or shredding.

Tree was 3 pieces, I wrapped the tree sections with that stretchy cellophane packing wrap - best way I can imagine to control the needle fluff. That left me a 4' x 24"" base, a 4' by 18"" mid section, and a 2' x 12"" top.  Base went in large end first, mid section skinny end first, and that left a lot of room for the top at the opposite end of the bag; also dropped a few more Christmas display items in for good measure.

The result was heavy; but lifting the bag didn't result in any tears or punctures (honestly, I was expecting one of the pole ends to push through at some point).  Once I had the bag where I wanted it, I tied a rope to one of the end handles, and hoisted the bag off the floor.  Now the tree is out of the way, and stored in a good spot where it won't get banged around.

The duffel bag is probably too big for most any other use I can imagine; but was perfect for storing my $400 tree.  Though I may buy another to store ALL of my camping gear in one spot and allow me to lift it off the floor, too. Hmmm...  glad I wrote this review :)",0

Not only is he incredibly picky but he has wide feet and can not stand a tight fitting shoe  He would wear nothing but Sanuk's if he could but with snow on the ground, that is not very practical.

I purchased him both the Timberland Chestnut Ridge and these FRYE Dakota boots at the same time.  He tried both out around the house and decided to keep the FRYE.  The Timberlands were too narrow and the leather not nearly as supple as the FRYE, making the fit very uncomfortable.  He also thought the FRYE boot was just better looking overall.

After he wore the FRYE Dakota boot several times, he gave me the following feedback --

These are really great looking boots.  They offer excellent support/comfort around the ankles.  They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feels great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.  They have room in the toe box for my wide feet but not so much that they feel loose.  They sort of hug my foot but because the leather gives a bit, it's not an uncomfortable feeling at all.  Nice bonus -- they also add an inch or so to my height but hide it very well.

Thank goodness I finally found a boot he likes.  Hopefully FRYE lives up to its reputation for making long lasting boots!",0

The sleeves seem a bit too short for my liking, the body a bit too long for my liking. Perhaps that evens things out! But the overall size is nice, not too baggy and not too tight. Maybe a bit baggier than I'd like - it looks just like the picture - I could go for something a tad more form fitting.

The sleeves are a bit short for my liking; raising my hands up pointing ahead of me results in about 3 inches of arm are exposed.

The body length is a bit too long for my liking by about 2-3 inches. I was worried this would be very form fitting and thus wouldn't allow for a heavier shirt underneath. But the the small fits me about the way shown in the product picture. There's room for a sweater/sweatshirt.

The areas with fleece are warm, soft and comfortable. The sleeves do not have a fleece lining but they too are very comfortable - after all, arms move a lot so having a thinner material makes for easier movement. Nice.

I would not mind if it was a BIT more form fitting, it's ever so slightly frumpy (again as seen in the product photo).

Aside from the sizing.. it's still very comfortable.

I do think that they will be a little bigger than I expected, but I am sure they will be perfect.I really love these boots! I have them in a size 8, and they fit like a glove!

I wear a size 8.5, and these fit really small.  I would recommend getting a size up, but they are very small.  The fabric is thin, and the shoe is not comfortable.  The sole is very soft, so I would not recommend buying them in size 8.5.  I would recommend getting a size up, but they are very narrow.I had a pair of these and loved them.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I don't like to wear pantyhose because I don't like the compression around my midsection.  However, I had a wedding to go to and it was cool enough that I didn't want bare legs.  I had a long skirt, but I wanted stockings longer than knee-highs just to be on the safe side.  So I figured I would try these.

These fit me pretty well.  I am right in that height/weight combination where I can wear either A or B sized pantyhose, and I'm a size 8 or medium in most US-sized pants and skirts.  They had a slight reinforced toe, which I appreciate, as I tend to get runs in pantyhose/stockings/etc.

These had no holes or runs in them and I did not damage them when I put them on.  This is a big plus since I tend to ruin a lot of garments of this type.  These seemed particularly sturdy to me.  They stayed up.  The silicone part is inside the lace at the top and it is clear so it will not show, even if you intend for the tops of these to show (I'm hiding mine well under my skirt, but the option is there for you if you want it).

There were a few loose threads at the top but they weren't terribly noticeable.  In the end, because these fit and seemed really sturdy, I'm quite happy with them.  You can be practical with them if you want, too, if your skirt is long enough, or you can show off the tops for a different look.

It is a little heavier than I expected. I wear it to work and to go to the gym. I'm not sure if I would be able to wear it in the rain or not. I just wish it had a more stretchy feel. It's a nice looking shoe. It's not a bad shoe for wearing at the gym. I just wish I could have gotten a few sizes bigger. I wish I had purchased a size larger. I have a wide foot and this is what I wore. I'm 5'3"" and this is the right size for me. I would definitely buy another pair. I'm 5'4"" and it fits perfectly.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I usually wear a 7 or 7 1/2 in most sandals, but I ordered an 8 due to reading the reviews.  I am so glad that I did.  They fit just fine. After one day, I got an abrasion to the top of my foot from the sandals.  I am not sure if it was because of the amount of walking I did, or were they shoes too closely fitted?  I have only worn them once, and I walked for quite a bit on the first day.  They were very comfortable and the nice lining helps your feet to not sweat.  So far so good, with exception of a small cut on top of each of my feet.  Hopefully it is just having to break the shoes in one day.

August 2014...Months later... these must be the worst Born sandals purchase ever.  Every pair I have purchased have been worn and worn.  However, the top strap of the shoe digs into the top of your foot.  I even had my daughter try them since she has smaller feet than me, and the top rubs slightly against the top of your feet when walking.

If you do not do a lot of walking, these shoes may be for you.  However, the top strap will rub gently, at first, into the top of your foot.  After a few hours, that gently part will start to form redness on your feet.  I never had Born shoes that did that to my feet before.  Maybe I just got a bad pair because it is mostly just the left shoe.",0

They are not the softest pajamas I have purchased for him, but after a couple washes/dries they have already gained a more comfortable feel. They're nice and lightweight for the summer heat. I purchased size 3T for my 34"", 30 pound 18 month old and they fit great with some room to grow in. He typically wears 2T-3T in clothing, so I'd say these are true to size. The shirt is long and narrow - it has a nice fit on my son. I like that this shirt is tag less - my kiddo often tugs at shirts with tags, as his skin is quite sensitive. The shorts come down to his knees and are a ""fitted"" style but a little loose on my boy. I like that in pjs - I feel that would be more comfortable during his sleep. My son enjoys wearing his new pjs and actually pulled them out of his pajama draw to wear when it was time to get ready for bed. He approves!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"I almost loved these shoes...I do really like them.  My 3 year old has wide feet and he really likes slip on ""boat shoes"".  The problems with those shoes are they get stinky and he falls in them.  I looked at alllll the shoes on Amazon and these were my number one choice.  Visually I love the color combination.  The velcro strap fits great and the shoes are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  He ran like a crazy man the first time he wore them and he was super excited that he didn't fall down!  I feel like much of the comfort comes from the width in addition to the general support provided from the shoe.  My only real complain is that after a week of so the shoes had little fuzzies from the material all over the gray part of the shoe.  I'm sure I could probably pick them off, but I don't have time for that.  They are still great as far a comfort and function, they just lost the new look a bit quicker than I anticipated.  I definitely recommend these shoes for anyone who has a kiddo with wide feet!
**This is my first New Balance purchase and I will definitely check out what they have available when purchasing his next pair of shoes**

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This is the fourth Skagen watch I've owned.  It's my favorite so far, but all of them have been great. The first is still working, but is looking a little worn, due to my having worn it as a ""barn"" watch whil working with my horses, and also during various other outside activities.  It even survived an accidental laundering, and still worked.  The second watch was very pretty and a little more stylish, but developed a problem with coming unlatched--lost it while shopping, and I imagine someone found themselves a nice watch. The third watch is still nice, with the exception of several broken strands of metal on the band.  I will probably have the band replaced and use it as a back up, since it still works fine.  The only other thing any of these has ever required is the occasional battery replacement.

As to my present watch, it's my favorite because I really like the style; it's small enough not to overwhelm my small wrist, but easy to read.  It's the typical, practical Skagen stainless steel, but polished enough to be dressy.  The gold tone numbers make it more versatile, as it blends well with gold tone jewelry.  The band seems to be a little heavier quality than the other watches, and was much easier to adjust the length. The only problem I can speak of, and it's a very minor one, is that the stem is a little stiff and it was hard to turn when setting the time.  This shouldn't be an issue after the initial set up, so it doesn't detract from my rating this watch excellent.",0

I just went with the XL and it's just a bit loose.  I would not recommend these for any other purpose.These are great.  I love the fit.  They are a little too tight, but not too tight.  The only negative thing is that the fabric is a little thick.  I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and they are a little short in the torso, so I'm going to keep them for a short while.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I love sandals, especially since I live in the Phoenix area where it is sandal weather nearly year-round.  I have many, many brands of sandals from cheapie flip-flops to expensive dressy low-heel sandals, to go with all manner of clothing, casual to classy. However, I think I have found my perfect sandal with these!  Comfort, style and support - all-in-one.  I have a casual colored pair now, but can easily state that other colors will meet the nearly classy mode for slack outfits.  I have a high in-step and these sandals support every millimeter of my soles. The adjustable straps would allow for wider feet, although with my narrow feet, I could easily want a bit more tighter fit; however, foot movement is minimal due to  tri-band construction of these beautiful sandals. My new goal is to begin the process of getting these sandals in all the colors that fit my clothing/color style...which may be all of them!!!!

PROs:
Little to no break-in time required!!! Honest!
Great fit with adjustable straps...all three straps!
Excellent supporting foot-bed.
Quality materials.  Love the leather smell!
Flexibility. Sandal can flex in perfect harmony with natural body movement.
Sole - perfect on all surfaces!
Decorative medallions and bead - adds a touch of fun!
Fit - true to size...I wear a 6.5 - 7.0 and a 7 was just slightly bigger as I would expect in a quality shoe that comes only in whole sizes.
Love the mixed colored selections and the metallic leather choices!

CONs:
None....I tried very hard to find a negative in these sandals but could not come up with one.  Oh, perhaps I wish there were even more colors!  Patent black leather, cream, silver, light blue...",0

The chain itself is very small, and the inside of the chain is stretched out.  It's a little thin, but it's not too big.  The chain itself is very pretty, and the color is a very pretty blue.  I've had the chain for a few months now, and I think it's going to last a long time.  The material is very light, and the color is very vibrant.  I haven't had it in a while, but I'm sure I'll be getting it in the next couple of weeks.  The reason I bought this pair was because the sizing is off.  I didn't like the color at all, and it's not the best looking chain I've ever had.  I'm still wearing it, but I don't really like it.  It's pretty cute, but I'm not sure how it'll hold up.

I ordered the black dress with a red edge/outline on the neck and bow. The dress arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It was packaged in a plastic bag. I definitely would recommend upgrading to the gift-wrapping service if you are sending this dress as a gift.

I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.

The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL. I also was happy that I can wear my normal bras with this dress and the straps do not show, seriously, look at the pictures. The bra is not visible!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"These fit comfortably, no binding or anything anywhere, form fitting but not tight when sitting or bending.

The side pockets without buttons are handy, I like the slid in slot for a cell phone, but the rest of the pockets are mostly useless for me.  The front pockets are deeper than I'd prefer, and I've never been a fan of buttons on pockets.  The buttons on the back I just leave unbuttoned, since I only have a wallet I put back there, and the main pockets on the sides of the shorts I don't even use, just the smaller pockets for the cell phone.

The other downside is that the material is just a little too light for my taste.  I haven't had any issues with these, but I had a similar pair and last summer simply bumping against the rounded handle of my lawnmower's plastic push control was enough to split them in front of the pocket, not even in a seam, but in the middle of a panel.  These are a light, thin material like those were, so I'm going to be extra careful since I would prefer something a little more sturdy.

The color was rather darker than the picture showed as well - I like it, but if you're looking for something on the tanner side of the spectrum, these aren't the shorts you're looking for.

Belt is pretty much for display purposes only, I've never been a fan of this type of buckle.

I prefer T-back style bras because I absolutely hate when a bra strap falls down on your arms.  I am 135 pounds, 5'1"" and about a C cup.  I used the measurement advice found on the descriptions, and it showed me to be a 36C.  I am returning this bra for the following reasons:  1. The material is thin.  No padding, just a stretchy fabric.  I didn't realize this, so I guess I missed that in the description.  I might have kept it had it fit.  2. I had ""fall out"" all around the cup.  Not just a little, but a lot.  The straps were tight, and it goes up high on the collar bone, so there was literally breast poking out all the way up to the shoulders and collar bones area.  Have never had that experience before.  I loosened the straps to the lowest/longest position, and it only lightened the ""squish"" a little bit.  Still fall-out.  3. it was scratchy.  And to top it off, it was an expensive bra. THe other one I ordered (Bali) was only $16...and it fit like a dream.  Lots of support, comfortable, could sleep in it if i had to.  I know that Wacoal is a good bra maker, but I was looking for features that this particular bra did not deliver.

You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.

I am 5'6"" and weight 152lbs currently, and I ordered this Vedette body suit in a Small.  I am pleased with the fit.  Yes, you have to work to get it on.  But that's the mark of good shapewear.  I chose to move to Vedette because they have several smaller sizes once I lose additional weight.  My natural measurements are currently 38-30-38.  In my small Maidenform I am 37-29-38.

The Vedette is a much thicker material.  Especially in the stomach.  The material does not breathe really at all, so your skin will sweat if you wear this for 12 hours.  I didn't realize I was sweating until I took it off this evening, and my skin was damp beneath the body suit.  The body suit itself was not damp, so I was surprised.

But after putting them on and looking closer, the three finger tips (first two fingers + thumb) are indeed made of a different material that provided a high degree of responsiveness on our iPad.  Score one for the gloves!  Alas, I had less luck with my iPhone, where my thumb is needed for typing.  There is a seam that runs across the top of the thumb exactly where my fingers come into contact with iPhone, rendering the ""Capacitive Material"" useless.  WIth a slight roll of my thumb, or shifting of the seam, I could get them to work properly.  But definitely a design flaw.

2) I ran an errand first thing the next morning - about 25 degrees outside.  Based on the knit material, I was less than surprised to discover these gloves lack sufficient warming properties to qualify is ""Cold Weather Gear.""  I would not recommend these much below 45 or 50 degrees.

3) The material is highly porous with skin visible through the material.  There were loose threads as well, straight out of the package.

If you are going to use these in a cooler room, or in mild weather, they could work for you.  But don't plan to wear them in truly cold weather, or expect to get much long term use out of them.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I wanted a compact rain shell for traveling; it is better to pack layers instead of carrying a big coat. This rain jacket is impenetrable to water when I run a sleeve under water, and it is completely dry afterwards. I have not used it in the rain yet.

I bought the jacket ""big"" so it could be a shell and I could layer underneath it (with a packable down coat, fleece, and/or hoodie). On its own, the jacket looks comfortable and cut nicely, but not big. I am 5'6"" 105 lbs and bought size medium for growing room (I like jackets loose anyway), but it already looks great as it is.

This jacket has features I did not expect, including elastic around the bottom hem (length comes to mid pelvis) and the around the hood for cinching. There is a mesh flap in the back for breathability. These are great features. I noticed the hood is not oversized at all. Cinched up, I think I could probably keep my face dry.

The tag on my jacket said it was $60, but I got it for less than $28; love the Amazon price! It also says it packs into itself, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I rolled it up and am using hair bands.

I dropped the rating because the color represented is not the color I received, even though I like it. ""Bright rose,"" instead of being a dark magenta as is shown, is just darker than hot pink. I'm not picky about my pinks though, so I'll wear it. This color would be cheerful on a wet day, but it will stand out in a crowd.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"We are heading to Maui and are planning a snorkel trip to the Molokini crater, but have gotten the worst sunburns from snorkeling in the past, because the sunscreen washes off so quickly in the salt water.

Pros
- My son really liked this rash guard/sunscreen top.
- The unique white stitching gives it some style (over just plain black).
- We ordered one size up from his normal size, and it fits quite snugly, so the sizing is about
  two sizes smaller than his typical American size shirt.
- It is well sewn and dries quickly.

- If ordering again, he would probably order two sizes up from his normal size.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"First off: the footbed is wonderful for my P.F. prone feet. Feels REALLY good right from the moment I put them on.
Second: These run wide. I have a foot that is B when not swollen (at the high end of B width) and C width when swollen (and I get swelling with some regularity). So, if you have a narrow foot, the very last closure of ankle and at toes is not gonna be narrow enough, and if you run a slender B width (slender end of that range), you'll likely find this very loose. I found it loose.
Third: the ankle strap is slightly irritating on the inner ankle, slightly.
Fourth: The front strap (adjustable) is a little irritating outer edge of the foot. This might be due to roughness in the strap, or even due to the looseness. I put it on the tightest adjustment, and it was slightly loose. That may have led to the rubbing aspect.

But that footbed! Wow, if they could perfect the sizing issues I read about and the adjustments, this could be perfect. The footbed is a dream of support for my arch and heel cup nestling.

I hesitated a while before plunking down 139 for shoes. If my feet hadn't been super-achey this month, no way. I still wonder why it is so pricey given the quality control issues (sizing issues, strap looseness in some styles, etc). But I ordered this in black and have ordered the tan, too. Despite the irritation of straps, the coddling of my soles is preicous, and when my upperfoot aches (the bones), having less constriction as this style provides helps.

The style is a bit matronly, so don't expect the height of fashion. Just nice support and comfort for troubled soles.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I purchased this bag in truffle which is a dark grayish color with a bright pink/coral inner liner color,  I wanted a convertible bag family vacations and the safety features made this the perfect bag for that.  Bag is roomy and will hold all the stuff I need to carry around when we are out and about on vacation.  The 2 side pockets and the top pocket all lock the front two pockets do not lock but they are great for non value things that you need to grab quickly.  The locking clips are a little hard to do at first but once you figure them out it's not a problem.
The main reason I selected a convertible bag is I wanted something that is a backpack for being hands free or it can be switched to a crossbody bag for going into a museum or a place that you can't have a backpack.
My only dislike about this bag is the handle strap across the top.  It looks really weird because it sticks out several inches making it look strange when it's on your back & it actually makes it a little unsafe when you have it on since it would be very easy for someone could grab it and pull you over with it.  I took a seam ripper and took it off (you can't cut it because the metal that runs through it to make it slash/cut proof) and I will just use the metal hoops for the strap when I use it as a crossbody bag.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I have worn Levi and Wrangler jeans for over 40 years. In recent years I have not been able to find Levi branded jeans in my local Target and Walmart stores. Several pairs of Levi jeans have been worn until they have become threadbare. I love them but replacement has been needed. After looking in Target and Walmart stores I could not find the Levi brand. The  stocked Wrangler brand is decent and costs $ 20 - 25. The  Wrangler sizes are very inconsistent and each pair should be tried on to verify that they fit properly. No two pair seem the same.  However, The Levi brand jeans always fit better and sizing seemed consistent. The Levi denim fabric was a heavier material than the Wrangler brand.

Not having a local source for the Levi brand, I ordered through Amazon. The jeans were about $ 40 vs. the $ 25 Wranglers
available locally. Upon arrival I immediately noted the denim fabric was much thinner than even the Wranglers. As a matter of fact, it was the same thin fabric used on the Walmart house branded jeans.

The zipper and zipper pull were SMALL... much smaller than anything I have ever seen on a pair of adult  jeans. The zipper and pull looked like what used to come on my son's boy jeans.

Last, the jean's waist and length were at least 2 inches large. Years ago, Levi jeans tended to be a bit tighter than other brands.

In summary, the fabric, the zipper, and inconsistent sizes are all  very sub-par. The insult of paying an extra premium price for something much inferior to the Wrangler brand has been a big disappointment.

This pair was made in Egypt with Egyptian fabric.

It seemed to fit about the same as most standard ladies hats of this type, possibly a little looser as I have a big head and tend to find most hats slightly small until they have been broken in and stretched. This fit well from the get-go. There is a slight amount of adjustability (there's a velcro closure by the bow on the back) but not much. The construction on it is solid and seems like it will hold up to a lot of wear - already been through the wash once after being thrown in a mud puddle and stepped on by my toddler, and it still looks good as new.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I Was Looking For -
1) Large cavity satchel to carry paperwork when traveling overseas  2)  locking system  3) sturdy and lightweight

PROS  -  Locking system to keep others from getting in main compartment.  Lightweight and feels like sturdy material.  Strong straps with wire running through it.  Nice compartments as described by company.
Front pocket not very deep.  It is the length and depth of a boarding pass.  You can definitely fit other small objects in there as well.  It works.

CONS
1)  was expecting the bag cavity/opening to be larger but it wasn't, disappointing.  With the purse measuring 13"" at THE BOTTOM of the bag, THE TOP opening measures at 9 3/4"".  It does not open wide enough to slip in an 8X11"" paper/documents.  With the top not opening wide, this makes it restrictive to access things and harder to see into the bag. I have small hands and it's still awkward getting my hands in there.
2)  The lock and latch needs to be on the opposite side so it is in front of your body so you are not reaching behind you in an awkward movement to unlatch the purse.  I will be wearing this bag backwards with the latch in front for easy access.
3)  average plastic zipper, not a heavy duty kind of quality.

OVERALL -  I will be keeping the bag because I paid $25.00.  It's worth that at the top end but I would not pay more then that. If I did, I would have returned it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Love this watch. I've got several of their AMW320 and also AMW330 series, and I'm very pleased with all of them. This also comes in a gold version with gold bezel and a white-face version with stainless bezel. I have both.

I consider this a dressy 'snorkel' watch, good for active sports but also dressy enough for a conservative office. The dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions, so it's not designed for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 feet and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses.
Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light levels against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels.

This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious.
I've worn mine as a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still looks great.
The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment.

I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version as well, and look at the AMW320 series also (same watch style but with a digital time/day/date inset). The AMW320's are equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too.

There's nothing not to like about this watch. The rubber factory band is fine, but these all really look good on a nylon Nato strap (if you're not familiar with those, google it).

- Neck line is beautiful - it drapes nicely on the chest, and would work for small or big-busted
- Length is great - hits right below the knee (and will probably hike up just a bit as belly grows)
- Ruched pattern in the front and in the back creates slim silhouette and has plenty of fabric to expand as pregnancy progresses
- Unless it fades or shrinks in laundry, I see myself wearing this dress when not pregnant - it would look nice on a curvy figure.

I think I will get it in a couple other colors, as it seems to be able to take me through summer and upcoming Fall.
If I accessorize right (tights or no tights, necklaces or shawls, shoes or boots) - it would work for the office and for going out.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This review is for the Ekouaer Womens Satin Robe Wedding Party Wear (Red, XL).

This nightgown is elegant, classic and feminine. I got the red color, the red was a little brighter than I expected but really very lovely. I also purchased the XL size. I am a size 12/14 and it does fit but its a little small. If you are a larger then a size 14 this will NOT completely tie closed. It does tie closed on me, but its open in at the bottom and doesnt completely wrap like its supposed to.

The fabric is a beautiful, soft red satin. This does need ironing so if you are traveling with it, pack a travel steamer. I think its because the fabric is so delicate. Despite the fabric being so satiny, this is NOT see through, so if you are wearing your bra and panties underneath you cant see them when its completely closed.

The lace detail is amazing, the neckline has THICK bandings of lace sewn down the front, the sleeves have lace trim and it goes up into the sleeve to give it some design flare. The lace is white or slightly off white, but it is VERY QUALITY lace and not unraveling, falling off or threatening to tear at any part. In fact, the craftsmanship and detail of this robe on a whole is VERY well made, this is something you would pay a lot of money for at the higher end retail stores. If you like delicate lingerie that is classy and makes you look good, try this robe out and you will enjoy it! 5/5 stars

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"How cute (or sexy!) are these? What a fantastic idea, they took something that was needed by millions of women (chafing guard) and made it both practical and adorable. They come in a handful of colors here on Amazon as well as their website (where I ordered mine.) I got them in Black. For me, the size small was just right. MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE - don't make any assumptions on your size. How embarrassing would it be if this fell down because you got it too big.

This is very well made and has built in clear silicone rings - one at the top and one at the bottom. These are what keep it from sliding up or down. I tried really hard to a get a good photo to show the rings, but couldn't get the exact quality I was hoping for (because they're so clear.) I also took a photo of me wearing it down low on my thigh - I wasn't comfortable posting a photo in the proper place, and because it's lower than I wear it, I had to hold it in place with my hand. You get the point from the picture...

This works well to protect against chafing in dresses, skirts, short and pants. While it's not marketed as any kind of secret storage, it CAN (in my opinion) be used for this within reason. To do this, it's critical you get the right size... you COULD stick your ID, a CC and some cash inside the band (between the clear bands). It may even hold a cell phone, but I haven't tested it with anything that weight.

Overall, I really like these! Adorable (and sexy), and practical. I like mine and recommend them for others. I hope this review has helped others considering this purchase.",0

What was in the box from Amazon. I planned to open it later, but my nosy family insisted on seeing what I had. So, I finally opened my package. I had 3 items in there from Amazon, one of which was a pretty little black box. I opened it knowing it would be these earrings. As soon as I took them out of the box everyone oooed and ahhhhhh'd. Then they all said they look really expensive. My mother had recently celebrated her 75th birthday, which is in May. She grabbed them out of my hands and said she loved them and that this was her birthstone, so she would like to have them. She told me she would give me a check for them once she got home. My mother is a simple lady and not materialistic at all, so the fact that she was so taken by these speaks volumes for the quality. She then put them in her ears and proudly wore them home. I told her that since she loved them so much I wanted her to keep them as another gift for her special birthday.
These are gorgeous, well made and they did come with the different backings. One is called a butterfly backing, and not sure what the other is called. Anyway, I guess I will be ordered another set and will not be opening in front of anyone, lol.
I and the rest of my family would recommend them. They are small, but impressive. It is true what they say that good things come in small packages.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I typically read the negative reviews before I buy something.  This review primarily addresses some of the negative reviews.  I've owned a black one for about 18 months and it is by far my favorite light weight jacket.  I have a camel color on order.  Some say it's larger than what the size label says...  Well, one needs to realize it is a ""golf"" jacket.  Hence, it is extra roomy in just the right areas for a golfer to take a full swing and not feel inhibited.  The medium I own fits like a medium should in the jacket and arm lengths, and the shoulder seams are exactly where they should be.  I have worn this jacket with a polo shirt and it's roomy, but fine.  I've also worn it with two layers of tee shirts and a sweatshirt, and went golfing...  It was great!  Regarding quality issues...  I have worn this jacket at least 250 days over the past 18 months and it shows no signs of wear.  I owned a London Fog overcoat many years ago, and the pocket stitching started unraveling after about 1 year; I sent it to London Fog (I paid for shipping) and they sent me a new overcoat (they paid for shipping).  Three inside pockets...  one on each breast and a lower one for a cell phone.  I've carried a Kindle in one breast pocket, a 7 inch tablet in the other breast pocket (both with protective cases) and my cell phone in the lower inside pocket, and keys and other miscellaneous things in the outside pockets.

They arrived fast, is of a decent quality however, the back of the shoe defies logic. the designer of this shoe should have worn them and then modified them accordingly. The shoe has a very hard ish plastic piece of material that for reasons known only to the designer of this shoe that jute's up past the rim of the sneaker to rub painfully into the back of your calf. this is why, i stated you can wear it for an hour or less but and a big but...if, you have a high tolerance to pain. this is the only area of this shoe that is vastly lacking in foresight and a flaw in its otherwise excellent design. i decided to modify my shoes myself and keep them because they are cute and of course, an earth shoe but seriously, designer!!! modify your design. i might not be so forgiving or tolerant of a poor design flaw where if extra thought were given, as in, the prototype had been worn by the designer, they would have very quickly realized the flaw and modified before mass production and because, this is not to be expected of an earth shoe brand, in other words, it shouldn't exist. i have purchased an arch insert to boost up the arch as I have a high arch and needed extra support, since its a lace up shoe, it has a very generous room for your toes. i ordered a 9 women size which, is a size larger than I normally wear so i would have more room for the fall and winter months when i wear boot socks.",0

Knowing that though, if you're thinner than me, or a different shape (I am an apple) I would buy at least a size up. I will say though I tested this just like any other clothing I get to test and review in exchange for my honest unbiased feedback. I don't hand wash. Anything. Ever.

The buckle is very sturdy and the band is very flexible.  The strap is not so thin as to be uncomfortable.  It is not stiff like a watch.  I like the strap.

It is a very pretty watch.  I will be getting another one soon.

I adjusted the watch band by taking out one link and it was the most difficult watch I have ever adjusted.  I have watch tools and have adjusted, fixed and worked on a number of watches and other jewelry.  Getting the pin back in proved extremely difficult.  Once you pull it out the other piece of the band moves and it is very difficult to line it back up and get the pin inserted again.  typically this is a 5-10 minute job but with this watch it took hours.  After wearing the watch for 2 weeks, it literately fell off my wrist one day.  Lest you think I did not adjust it properly, it was the other side of the band not even close to the the adjustment I made.  I was not doing anything strenuous either, unless you consider typing on a laptop strenuous.  Because of this I have had to downgrade my rating for 4 to 2 stars.  Very disappointing!

If you are looking for a nice looking watch with little options at a good price this might be the watch for you.  This watch will not give you the date, does not have a faceplate light or glow, but it does keep good time and it looks very nice.  It is lighter weight than you might expect but seems to hold up fine with normal wear.  If you are concerned about a watch you can wear in the pool or need to see the date this isn't for you.  Overall this is good watch for the guy who wants to not spend a lot but have a good looking watch on his wrist.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Came in the mail really fast! 2 days time. Very good quality made ring. The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

God bless you all & may peace be upon you! I humbly ask for your prayers as I'm entering into Holy Matrimony here in 3 more days for a peaceful marriage, life longevity & happiness

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

INITIAL LOOSE FIT REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED COMFORT!

So it's OK if you have a loose fit with it. It will shrink over time. Very happy all around with this purchase.",0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,CG,"I like this jacket, it looks great and the materials are good. I have a large chest and a medium in the front. I also like the shoulders, so it is not too bulky. It is a good value for the price. I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He's a huge fan of the sneaker and it fits him so well. He says it's very comfortable and he's wearing it all the time. I got the black and it is exactly what I wanted. I've only worn it twice, but it's a great addition to his wardrobe. He doesn't have a lot of arch support, but it is very comfortable. I got a small and it fit perfectly, and he likes it. He's a big fan of the shoes, so I think it's great. I'm sure it will last him a while, but the price is right. He's a little disappointed in the quality of the material, but he's happy with it. He'll be wearing this sneaker all the time. Great, very comfortable, and I ordered size up. I wore them for a week and they fit perfectly. I'm very pleased with them. Great purchase!Great shoes. These fit great.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling.",0

The front pocket is perfect for the wallet, so it's easy to carry and it's convenient to carry your cards, credit cards, and other stuff.

This wallet is a nice wallet for the price, and I like it so much that I have bought another one for my husband.  I'm very pleased with this wallet!

It's not really a bad wallet, but I'm not sure I would use it for anything other than driving.  It's a nice wallet.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"The bracelet from Cat Eye Jewels is a stunning. Elegant is actually the word I used in the review title, and that fits too. So does beautiful. I received the ""March"" version of this piece, which includes a aquamarine colored stone beads along the bracelet and also one that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels fantastic in person.

I like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry. The 10mm stone beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.

When laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). This bracelet weighs in at about 1.2 ounces per our postal scale, so it looks and feels beautiful and classy.

I lightly buffed the stones and small silver portions with a soft microfiber cloth, and it gave the bracelet a very nice sheen to it. The silver and aquamarine colors look unbelievably great together; I think that this has become my favorite now.

There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.

If you are looking for a beautiful, elegant bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would highly recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.

Very recommended.

The front part of the shoe is very tight, and it's very uncomfortable. I tried to get it on, and it was too tight to wear. The shoe also had a hole in the side, so I had to return it. I think the front part of the shoe has a hole in it, but that's not the case with this shoe. The shoe was very comfortable, and I'd recommend it. I'm very happy with this purchase!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.
 Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.

Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I was really surprised at the size and weight of this watch! I got it for my son who is very athletic, but he's not a big man! Tall, slender and fit...YES, but not bear-sized like one of the reviewers. :-) I feared that he wouldn't like it because of the size, but he certainly allayed that worry. He told me he even wore it while playing soccer and it was comfy, which surprised everyone.

Anyway, it's perfect for him and he loves it. We both agree that it's very attractive and sturdy. The green on the face adds just the right amount of eye-appeal without being flashy.

Truthfully, my son and I got into how ""pretty"" it is and how sports friendly, completely forgetting to comment on the accuracy of the time-piece...which is what any watch is all about, of course. :-) Well, when we finally got around to that, I learned that it's perfectly accurate. But with the INVICTA name, I'm not surprised.

Oh, it's just too lovely to describe... I hope you can get this and see for yourself.

Do study the manual that comes with it; makes it easier to understand the little intricacies of this phenomenal product.

Nothing else to say except that this is an amazing watch! Expensive, but well worth it because it's an upgrade from the other diver's watches on the market. Amazon's price can't be beat. (I saw the same brand at T.J. Maxx and even with their discount, it was much more than this.)

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special as far as looks go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirts when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me as much as my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of women prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide as much support as my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strikes a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I was glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder straps are comfortable and the hooks are strong and secure. I don't usually order bras online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it was going to function as a house bra and I was not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wires and feels nice and comfortable with just enough support.

I usually wear 8-8.5, and though I prefer a wide, I can wear most regular width shoes. These happen to fit me beautifully, but they don't seem like a true wide width right out of the box. However, the beauty of good quality leather boots is that they will stretch to fit over time. (Google has several good ideas for breaking in leather shoes. Though I didn't need it this time, the rubbing alcohol trick totally works.) I expected these to be tight, but they're not. My calves are about 14.5 inches, and the boots do fit over my leggings or jeans, but with NO room to spare. Keep that in mind if you have large calves. (I noticed that Timberland is now making this type of boot with an elastic inset in the shaft for wider calves. I don't think they are nearly as cute, though.) This boot is GORGEOUS. The leather is such a great color (tobacco) and it looks even prettier now that I've used mink oil on it. I can't wait for Fall so I can wear these boots all the time. They seem to be very well made, very expensive looking. I have short legs, so I love that they stop a few inches below the knee.

Eh, now that I have actually seen this bag in person (ordered and shipped direct to Mom for Mother's Day) today was the first time I saw it myself ... gotta take away one star .. and have to agree with the other reviewer regarding the (newly discovered!) shoulder strap attachments, or lack thereof.

I finagled the strap to attach on both sides via the metal attachments holding the short handles; one clip on one side and one on the other. It works, but it is kinda tacky looking. Strap stays out of the way and the bag is balanced, but it doesn't look good.

The bag is much larger than I figured it was going to be.  It's one thing to SAY x"" x x"", but you really have to SEE it to comprehend it. It's okay, but it is a little 'large'.

The cute little 'bow' on the front that sold me actually works and when you unfasten it it makes that tan flap flip up and reveal a tiny pocket under it.  Great storage for cash or credit cards, maybe a SMALL cell phone if you don't need it quick.

Tons of space in the main compartment but nothing zippered. Three individual compartments and the main compartment.

In my opinion, it's a better handbag than a shoulder bag. It is cute, it appears to be well made, give that it is not genuine leather - that stuff has it's setbacks too though.

For the price, and if you are in need of a handbag, I'd say yes to this one.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ordered for Mom and she loves it! She says there is plenty of room, it's a great color, she loves the decorative 'bow' on the front ... all of it! Just a complete success!

Arrived Saturday before Mother's Day, gift wrapped as requested ... thanks so much!

If this was a {Shoulder Bag}, I'd order one for myself (hint-hint!!)",0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,CG,"I'm a huge shoe enthusiast, and have been wearing these shoes for a long time. I have one pair that I have had for years, and they're the most comfortable. They're made well, and I can wear them all day, all day. I'm always happy to have these shoes on my feet.

I'm also a big fan of the suede shoes, and will continue to purchase them as I wear them all the time. I like that the suede sole is not too slippery, and that the color is a little brighter than I expected. They are a little too tight, but that's good because they're soft and comfortable. I'm not a big fan of the color, and I'm not sure if they'll hold up.

I'll be wearing these around the house, and I'll look for a pair of shoes that I can wear all day, no matter what I'm doing. I love the fit, the quality, and the quality of the leather. They're comfortable, but not too tight. I'll be wearing them around the house, and I'll be sure to wear them around the house.

I bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves it! He looks great with it! He loves it! I will buy more!Love these shoes.  They are so comfortable and fit perfect.  They look great with jeans or skinny jeans.  I am 5'2 and they are great for a skinny person.  They are so comfortable and easy to wear.  I wear them all the time. ",1
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"We purchase these cute little shoes for our little son and since he is a boy we chose this navy blue and white combination for him.  It looked so cute in the picture here online and when we got these on hand, it exactly looked like the photo.  We started examining it inside and outside and found it to be a very nice quality pair of shoes.  The texture of these shoes are soft but the material is not thin at all, thus it does provide your little one the needed protection for his feet when he starts walking or jumping with these shoes.  We have a bouncer at home which my son is absolutely much into.  He loved it so much but we noticed that he is using the tip of his toes when bouncing and my mom told us that we should be putting on shoes on him when he does bounce in the bouncer.  We used these pair of shoes and it helped a lot.  He is still getting used with it but we could see that he is happy with it.  We have not seen any signs of discomfort on his part upon wearing these shoes.  We removed the tassels as we do find it unnecessary.  It is a cute design though.  Anyway, overall, this is a very worthy purchase.  It actually has a bit of room for his feet to grow into which is nice for it means that he will be able to use these for a longer period of time.

The wallet is well made and the outside is thin enough to hold everything I need to carry. The wallet is a bit smaller than I expected and it's very comfortable. It's a little heavier than I expected but I love it! I can't say enough good things about this wallet! I'm very happy with this wallet! I'm looking forward to wearing it everyday for the first time!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance.

It's a good product and I'm very happy with it.I've had this bag for a few years now and it seems to be holding up well. It's very comfortable, looks great, is light weight, and holds up very well.  I haven't had it in a while but it's a good buy.I was a little worried about the quality, but it was just right for my son. I ordered the same size and I got the same size for my nephew. He has a small head, but I thought the length would be a little longer. I'm 5'2"" and the pants are a little snug. I ordered the Large because I normally wear a small and it fits great.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I was looking for a nice casual dress that I could wear for the spring and summer and luckily the opportunity came along to try this one. I likes it so much that I immediately ordered another in red and I might even get another color.
The dress fits me perfectly. I ordered mine in 3X. When I buy dresses similar to this style from Lane Bryant. I normally get the 18/20 size. The size chart of this dress list the 3X as suitable for 22W/24W. I guessed that the dress might run small... and in my case. I guessed right.
I wanted some brighter colors and the teal is really pretty and the red is a very bright and vibrant.
I like how light weight it is. It's very thin and that will keep me nice and cool especially in the summer heat. It's machine washable so I don't have to worry about a dry cleaning bill.
You can add a scarf or nice jacket to jazz it up for the fall you could even add leggings and/or a long sleeved shirt underneath for wearing it in cooler weather.
The only drawback is that the V-Neck plunges a bit too much, so I'll have to always wear a tank top underneath to keep my bra from showing.
It's not too long either. It falls right above the top of my feet, so I can wear it with sandals or heels. I'm extremely happy with this garment and highly recommend it.

He says it's very comfortable and he's wearing it all the time. I love the arch support and the elastic is a little stiff. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much.",0

The material is soft and a good quality.  The material is very light and breathable so I would buy again.  The color is just a little darker than the picture but still good.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.

The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.

they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I have narrow feet and a high arch, so need a shoe that has good arch support, good cushioning and low volume but still roomy toe box that is not too stiff.  I've been a Salomon fan and own several older model XA Comps/XA Comps GTX and took that on many trips (from hiking in the desert to trails in Hawaii).  I now need replacement shoes since I've killed the old ones.  For athletic shoes, I'm usually a 9.  For all Salomon, I wear a 9, same for these (I also wear 9 in ASICS, but 9.5 in Nike, Brooks and Puma).

I tried on just about every major brand to look for some trail hikers/trail runners and they all fit too wide.  I also tried the Salomon XA Mission, which got rave reviews, but the toebox fits extra wide.  I also tried the Salomon Crossmax, which had a great arch but fit like a motion control shoe, so my gait felt very stiff and unnatural.

The Speedcross 3 purple looks great and the fit is perfect:  strong arch support, well cushioned, hugs my narrow feet very well, low volume toebox but still plenty of room to wiggle toes. I also love the speedlaces, easy to use and works great.

The tread is very aggressive, which is great for mud and trail.  But I will warn that walking on hard surface felt a little weird as I can feel the treads ""wiggle"" (compress, tweak side-to-side and rebound), it's a low ""wiggle"" so I don't feel unstable in any way. Not sure how the treads will wear on hard surface over time.

The shoe also feels very light for a water resistant shoe, it's not Gortex but Climashield.  It's supposed to be breathable but I haven't tested the waterproofness yet, but will testing them soon on the trail.  Highly recommend for grass, dirt, any soft surface, trail or muddy/wet conditions.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I really want to give this watch 5 stars, this watch is excellent, high quality, accurate, and great looking, but it loses a star for the weight. Don't get me wrong though i understand all types of these watches are going to be heavy when compared to my g shocks. Wearing the watch daily is not very comfortable, it is a bit heavy and can get sweaty during the summer which is normal, but after weaing my casio g shock which cost $150. I really appreciated the lightweight and comfort of the affordable g shock watch. The seiko is indeed a classy watch but the downside is that is it heavier than my g shock which i end up choosing to wear daily.

This is a great watch for going out and relaxing, but for sports, work, daily tasks, the g shock is my goto watch since its lighter weight and more comfortable with its resin band.

It is hard to make a steel watch very comfortable compared to a resin watch. Otherwise everything else is perfection..Seiko is one of my favorite brand of watches, I would say my top favorite, then Casio, but realistically my daily wear is a casio g shock. If you type of watch is the classy look, then seiko is the best. It's kinetic technology is my favorite, i love how it adjust back to the correct time after i wake it up by a few shakes. It is amazing how accurate this watch is, I set the time and date once, and have had this watch for 4 years and not once did i ever need to readjust the time or date, it has been accurate this whole time.  this watch is excellence, but i deduct one star because I feel its a bit heavy as it should be but just not my cup of tea for a daily wear since I have a lightweight casio g shock as my option.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"As stated by the title...this product is NOT FOR TALL PEOPLE!  The zippered opening does not allow for someone much taller than about 5'11"" to get into it.  If you are short, you can get into the costume easily feet first.  If you are tall, you must go in head first, lay down and cross your legs and get someone to help you put your feet into the correct places.  I could BARELY bend my legs enough to fit them into the leg openings, even having wiggled my shoulders up into the head area as much as I could.  Now as long as you're under that height I mentioned, your weight doesn't matter a bit.  It's a very forgiving costume and would be very easy for a plus size person to wear.  I don't know what the limit would be, but we were able to get my ~300lb friend into it with no trouble.

The fan makes an annoying sound...so it's not like you could wear this to work and sit at your computer quietly.  But changes are...you're going to be running around like an idiot at a party in this thing so nobody will care about the fan whirr.

It does get hot inside and you will fog up the thing.  There's no way for this really to be avoided.  Costume feels super cheap when you take it out of the package and you'll need to find somewhere inside the suit to secure the fan.  I'm unable to wear this costume without having someone help me get in and out of it, due to my height, but if you're shorter you should be able to manage ok.

You can run, walk, bicycle, drive, sit, dance, all very easily.  It's very light and if you bump into something, it just deflates that part and fills right back up quickly.  Fun to run around in and scare children.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress.
I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Planning to travel to Japan meant a 14-hour flight  in coach!  That made it imperative that both my husband and I purchase and wear compression socks.  After I researched various brands and styles, Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large were better suited to my husbands picky preferences than other options.  Stockwell uses a higher percentage of natural fibers than many other brands of socks.  As a result, they wicked moisture better and did not make his feet to sweat more profusely.  They were firmer (20  30 mm Hg) than the majority of compression socks (10  20 mmHG).  The socks graduated compression and well-fitted feet made Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large the socks for him.

Sizing is always a challenge when it comes to purchasing any clothing online.  My husband wears an 11 to 11  Medium in shoes.  The Large/X-Large size fits him well and is comfortable.  At its maximum point, his calf is about 16 in circumference.  The socks extend to the crease in the back of his knees  about 17"" from the floor; this circumference of area also measures about 16.  His foot is 11 long and the circumference around the arch is about 9 .

Sockwell Mens Elevation Compression Socks, Black, Large/X-Large are constructed with care.  Unlike my socks that had a more prominent knot on one side of the toe area, my husbands socks had smooth toe seams.  The top of the sock has a rolled, zigzag-stitched hem that approximately 3/8 wide.  It has not rolled during wearing.

Although these socks can be machine washed and dried, I prefer to hand wash and dry them flat.  I believe this will increase their useful life.  Amazons price for these socks, combined with PRIME shipping and free returns, makes them a much better value than the same item purchased from one of the online travel clothing retailers.",0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,CG,"Updated review three years later. I love the look and fit of this bra. I ordered the size 6. 5 and it fit perfectly. The fit is perfect. The only thing I would change is that the size 6. 5 is a tad bit snug. The bra straps are a little tight on the chest, but the cups are not. I like the way it looks on my son. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!I'm a huge fan of the rose gold that I've bought at the top of this boot. The reason I bought this boot was because it has a lot of cushioning. I've had a few pairs of this boot and the ones that I've had have stayed on my feet well. It was very well made and was just right for my husband. He has a wide foot and this boot is perfect for that. I'm 5'4"", 130lbs and these boots are a little narrow for him. He's tall and they're a little tight on him, but he's not afraid to wear them. The material is thin and durable and the leather is very soft. I bought them for my husband and he's a bit disappointed that they didn't come up a size bigger. I'm 5'2"", 130lbs and I'm a big guy and these boots are perfect. They fit him perfectly and they're comfortable. I'd recommend these boots for any occasion.",1
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"The problem with buying a dress shirt, is that they are cut to fit 95% of the guys out there. So they are boxy. However, deviate from the norm, then you'll end up with a shirt that isn't long enough (if you're tall), maybe doesn't close around the stomach (if you're chubby), or pinches around the shoulders and upper arms (if you're muscular). I have the problem of shirts too tight around my shoulders and upper arms. Also, I can't move my arms forward without restriction, because it's too tight across the back. Sometimes I move up to a 2XL, but then it's way too baggy around my stomach. I have no idea what those muscleheads do who are jacked up on gear, but just being thick and solid, causes me problems enough. Since my thighs are pretty strong, I have problems with pants that I can sit down in too. That's when I discovered spandex woven into the cloth. If you're bulked up from the gym, its the only option you have, unless you want to buy clothes way oversized, and wear a belt. This shirt fits me well. It isn't tight around my arms and shoulders, since the cloth has give, when I move my arms. The waist doesn't billow over my waist either. I have long arms, but it fits well with arm length. The fabric has give, but it's not elastic the way socks are for example. Also you can forget to hang this shirt on a hanger, and still be able to wear it the next day without ironing. (It smooths out, when you have it on.) I like the blue graph paper design. Best of all, I'm not pinched around my chest and back either. Wearing a shirt that doesn't fit well, because I have to buy up a size might not bother me personally. However, a shirt like this is more form fitting, so I look a little neater. I hear neatness counts.",0

The second one is perfect, the first one was a little tighter than the second one, so I'm hoping it stays that way. I'm still waiting for the first one to arrive. I'm also going to be buying another shirt for my husband. He likes the style, but I'm not sure if it will hold up to the wear and tear of the first one. I'm going to have to buy another one for my husband. I'm glad I found these. I really like the shirt, and I'm happy to get another one in the mail. I got a small. I'm 5'7"" and I ordered a medium. It fit my torso perfectly. My waist is a bit too long. I wear a small and it was too big. I was able to get it down to a medium. I'm normally a size 13 and the medium fit perfectly.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I am a die hard fan of Gezer!! I purchased a pair of their ""Black Roses"" sandals over a year ago & from the first time I wore them it has been my go to sandal over all! I had this pair on my wish list for awhile, but I had a few polo, guess & Ocean Pacific sandals at the time so I put off buying for a moment....to my total surprise, the Black Roses by Gezer lasted longer than all the sandals I paid much more for...and none of them had a guided foot support or an arch like these do. I live in the southwest & I wear sandals even in the winter, and I walk an insane amount as I am in a personal weight loss program & walking is the kindest to my joints which have issues from my serious athletic days of basketball, performance dance, ballet & cheerleading...so I walk everyday, everywhere  up to 2-3 miles depending on my schedule and Gezer holds up and because of the arch & toes supports they are comfortable the entire time. I also bought another pair of Black Roses because my once chubby foot has shrunk considerably during my weight lose & the leather straps were too big, but still in beautiful condition!! The sole was even barely worn, after a year of almost daily user!!  I passed them onto my niece as she is pregnant & has chubby feet  now (: She put them on & immediately said...""OOOO, these are soo pretty!! AND comfortable!! ) These sandals are well made, durable, aesthetically pleasing and a steal for the price....not even my Bill Blass slip-ons are comparable. The ""red"", is not a red...it is light pink & dark pink with white accents, but I wanted pink, so...works for me. True to size. I wear a 8-9 & got a size Euro 40. LOVE THEM LOVE THEM LOVE THEM!!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I'm discriminating. Willing to pay for better/best quality. However, I planned to use this for a Disney Trip (2 adults, 2 kids) and I wanted a carry on as a back pack (to free my hands for car seats), then a smaller back pack for the park (instead of just a wheeled backpack only which would have been much bigger in the park than I wanted). This was fantastic. No problems on domestic flight with wheeled part (with day pack zipped off). Fit no problem straight in. Squishing straps great. I did NOT have much trouble with the pull arm as some reviewers, slight sticking at times but better than most of my luggage (NOT as good as my Victorinox for a comparison, but still very good). Zippers heavy duty and work well. Day pack holds much more than I expected, more like a true backpack (I had expected a little larger than a fanny pack. This is MUCH larger than that.). Water bottle slots hold CamelBak style bottles fine. Little compartment at top for earphones, charger, inhaler, medicines and front compartment held sunglasses, wipes, sunblock stick, snacks, etc. Main compartment had two rain jackets, two sweaters, magazines, sandwiches, snacks, baseball caps. My wife didn't really have to carry anything in the park. Even with all that, it slid right under the seat no problem, with room for my feet still. Some noted trouble zipping the day pack onto the main pack when full. I didn't bother as it has a nice ""hold a bag"" strap (like the Victorinox) that worked great, so didn't bother zipping on. If both full of hard objects, I could see some trouble, but if relatively flat, should zip on no problem. However, look around!! I found for just under $100 elsewhere. For that it was a steal. For the $175-200 range, I still think it is worth it (now that I have it). Bite the bullet, you are really getting two really good bags for one.",0

I did get a size 10 and it fit perfectly.  I will say that I had to use a size 8 to get it on.  I wear a medium in shoes and I got a size 10.  I really like the fit of this shoe.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"These shoes are so comfortable you will not want to take them off.  Even my sensitive feet with bunions are very happy in them.  True, they are not very elegant, since they look somewhat bulky, but at this point I prefer comfort over style.  The inner sole is soft suede with some cushioning underneath. I don't think the insole is real suede, rather it is microfiber and the upper lining is definitely synthetic fabric.

I bought black size 9.5 M and they are both slightly longer (26.7 cm=10.5 in) and seem wider than most medium widths since the fabric mesh allows more width flexibility above the sole.  They are not suitable for persons with very low or very high insteps as the zipper on top does not provide any width regulation (unless you leave the zipper partially open). The upper opening does not fit snugly on my low instep foot.  However the back sling has some elastic under the buckle, so the length is flexible and can be additionally adjusted by pin holes - I had to use the first pin hole. So, I would label them at least 9.5 W. I lowered the rating for incorrect sizing to fours stars.

The insole has perforations under the ball of the foot, which means the moisture gets under the lining and ... the odor stays longer. I used them in tropical weather (on a cruise, both on the ship and on the land) for less than a month and they already stink, though I do not have any sweating problem.

I also got surprised that my French shellac pedicure got stained, not only on the white strips, but on the clear body of the nails as well. My black microfiber suede tote bag also stained my French manicure, so this is the fault of the fabric stain (and shellac polish vulnerability). Maybe the light colored sandals don't stain though.

I lowered the ratings to three after one month due to these two problems.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I've been waiting for these boots all my life.  I have had severe lower back problems for a couple of decades.  I can do pretty much everything, including walking, without too much discomfort, but standing for any period more than a couple of minutes is incredibly painful.  Last weekend I spent 6 hours on my feet in these boots while canning and I never got sore at all.  Without sounding hyperbolic, these boots are kind of life-changing for me.  No other ""comfort"" shoe or boot has ever made one bit of difference in how I can function; these boots allow me to do everything I never wanted to do before: shop; socialize on my feet; work, etc.
As for the fit, I sized down as I have with my other FitFlops and there's still a little bit of extra room.  I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick socks make sense.  They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pairs of regular weight socks.
As for how they look, when I first put them on I thought they looked a bit like moon boots or Earth Shoes.  I was ambivalent about wearing them for the first couple of days and just kept trying them on in front of the mirror until I got used to them.  Now I LOVE the way they look and have gotten many compliments on how cute and stylish they are.  The look is a bit of a departure for me, as I'm used to wearing a bigger, more masculine boot, like a biker boot or a Doc Marten.  But these are adorable.  I love the extra height they give me.  I love that I can tuck my pants in or wear them over.  I've pretty much worn them every day for the last couple of weeks.  I'm already looking at getting a suede pair.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I am absolutely blown away by these pearls. I am a jewelry fanatic and these pearls are such high quality it blows me away. I ordered them for my daughter, my husband and I are trying to get pregnant and I have gotten quite excited and have already bought a fair amount of wardrobe items. I ordered these pearls thinking they would be excellent for the baby photos however, this set is more appropriate once she is a teenager. The size of the pearls is almost as large as my adult size necklaces and the length is only an inch smaller than my adult size necklaces!  This set is a fantastic value. I must admit, when I saw the High quality and great size of these pearls along with the excellent knotting between each individual pearl, I immediately put it around my own neck and looked in the mirror. I think these make excellent casual pearls for a small framed woman!  These are a fantastic value. In my photos I have this necklace along with my own pearl necklace which was around 1k I believe but that was so many years ago, I don't remember. I think the size of these pearls is FANTASTIC, the shapes of the individuals don't have the consistency and perfect shape as my older pearls have but this is because these are cultured pearls. I think the cultured look adds to the intrigue of this piece. I got the ribbon that is baby blue and I think it's the perfect shade and complements the necklace well. Pink may be too feminine in my opinion for these pearls. I love the blue. Once my daughter is a teenager, I think I will replace the ribbon with a clasp.

I am on a weight loss journey so im going to keep it and make it my goal to get to. The inner material reminds me of slip material and it was clingy but that also might be because of the sizing..but it did seem to have quite a bit of static. The outer layer is a very thin see-through material. it is where the design in printed and it is very beautiful. the inner layer is about a foot shorter than the outer layer.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I am extremely large-busted and was in search of a ""miracle"" bra to solve several problems I have with most bras.

1) My everyday bras with underwire were always poking, chafing and causing a rash.
2) Exercise was difficult since no bra supported me well enough to prevent bounce.
3) I needed a bra to sleep in for extra support but didn't want to buy a ton of bras just for that purpose.

The Fiona bra has come closer than any other I've tried at meeting my needs.  The material is soft and absorbent with no underwire, and yet I feel better supported (for everyday wear) than I did in a Bali underwire bra.  It moves with my body, absorbs sweat, and doesn't chafe or poke me anywhere, so it's very comfortable to sleep in.  It's also supportive enough for low-impact exercise; however, it is NOT supportive enough to prevent bounce while jogging or during other high-impact exercise.  Maybe that's just not a possibility for me and someone a little smaller would have better luck.  I should mention that I'm wearing this bra in size 44DD and that it's actually a little small in the cup area.  Fortunately, it launders well.  I haven't found any change in the bra's size or shape from putting it through my washer and dryer.

One other negative is that the bra looks like a sports bra with wide straps and seams running along the sides.  This is fine except for the fact that it makes it a little difficult to wear the bra under all tops as an everyday bra.  Depending on the cut of the top and the material, either the straps or the seams or both will sometimes show through.  This is annoying but not enough of an issue to make me stop using this bra for daily wear.

Overall, I find the bra to be excellent for my full figure.  Although it's not quite my ""miracle"" bra, I still plan to buy more of these.",0
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,CG,"OMG, First reason why I chose this style is because it is a nice fit for a person with a narrow foot.  The front of the shoe is slightly wider than the back, so that it is a little smaller in the heel.  The front is very soft and gives good support.  The straps are very comfortable and the material is very soft and soft.  The color is very nice and the material is very comfortable.  The only reason I didn't buy this style was because it is very short for a woman, but I am glad I did.  I am usually a size 6, but ordered a medium.  The length is perfect.  The fabric is soft, but the color is very bright and vivid.  It is a cute color to wear for a costume.  I wish it had the support that I need.  I would recommend this style for anyone.I really like these shoes.  I have had a few pairs of these in the past.  They are very comfortable and are very comfortable.

I knock softly three times; wait for two seconds and then twice again. The spy hole immediately opens and I can feel myself being visibly searched from my head to my toes. I see the eyes catch a glimpse of my Three Wolf Moon Tee shirt and then just the barest of a smile. Seconds later, I hear the sound of several dead bolts being released and I am welcomed into a vibrant room full of beautiful people. Led to my table by a beautifully tantalizing Oriental woman wearing a thigh high cut dress, I am immediately set upon by servants trying to catch a glimpse of my famously designed shirt. I cannot begin to believe my good fortune at just being admitted into the famous Che Le Torche Cabaret in Algiers. No questions asked, no cards required...Just service with a smile and almost a sense of reverence or perhaps I should say... awe. I am on my second straight tequila, when I sense the presence of someone standing at the edge of my table. A tall thin man in a while silk suit wearing a Panama hat wordlessly hands me a card with just one word on it.. ""Omar"". He asks if he might join me. I quickly judge this is a man to be reckoned with after noticing the long scar running from the edge of his mouth to his right ear.

""Why not? I reply.

Before the evening is finished I will have found not a friend, but a new business partner, who is destined to make me a very rich man.

The reason for my success?

Simple... Omar tells me that he could determine I was a man to be trusted and that he could rely upon because of my discriminating taste by owning and actually wearing a Three Wolf Moon tee shirt in public.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I'd consider myself an advanced non-professional photographer...which means I have a DSLR with two lenses (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Canon-EOS-Rebel-T3/dp/B004J3Y9U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Canon EOS Rebel T3</a>), an external flash, and a random assortment of other camera items (an old Canon point-and-shoot, a waterproof point-and-shoot, an HD video camera, the assorted SD cards, lens covers, etc.). I currently have the el cheapo Canon bag that came with my Rebel and I barely use it, so hoped that by getting a REAL camera bag, I'd be more apt to consolidate everything into one bag and carry it with me. Unfortunately, it hasn't been the case. I blame the fact that I'm generally already carrying a diaper bag with me, LOL.

PROS:

The bag is definitely WELL MADE. The fabric is thick and the stitching is heavy-duty. The velcro isn't sewn on cheaply so that it will start pulling off after a handful of uses. Comparing it to my Canon bag is like night and day. Everything on the Canon bag feels cheap while everything on the Lowepro feels luxurious.

The bag is very adaptable and adjustable. The insides are full velcro panels so that you can rearrange the inserts in any which way you need and there are lots of pockets. I like that the cover panel folds over onto itself so that the top becomes very easily accessible (being covered without actually being latched shut in any way).

There is no logo on the outside, so this bag could be any generic messenger bag. There's no clue that it could be holding thousands of dollars of equipment.

CONS:

If you don't have enough equipment to really fill it, it's a bit of overkill.

I actually thought about using it as a diaper bag, but it seems like it might be a little hard to clean if anything spilled on the inside.

OVERALL, I can see how this would be a rockin' bag to have if you were a professional photographer or had lots of equipment you needed to carry around at the same time. But for me, as the advanced home user, it's overkill.",0

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I cannot thank my boss enough for recommending Oofos sandals to me...my feet are in heaven!

My feet are wide, and flat. I call it ""Fred Flintstone Syndrome"". Trying to find shoes that a) fit correctly; and b) don't cause me to limp after a few hours is nearly impossible. I have literally spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars in the past five years trying to find footwear that I can actually wear on a day to day basis. I have tried orthopedic inserts, Dr. Scholls inserts...you name it - I've probably tried it at least once.

Sandals were by far the most difficult to find, as most do not offer any support at all. This results in my feet taking a pounding and me being in excruciating pain within an hour or so. Unfortunately, it is hot and humid where I live from May to late September - my feet sweat easy - so I really do not want to wear closed shoes and have to deal with *that* particular issue.

These Oofos...I'm in love. I can wear these all day, and my feet are so happy. The comfort, the arch support - phenomenal. I love the black/silver color combination - it looks very classy and goes with pretty much anything I wear. Seriously, these are more comfortable than my $200 running shoes. I can't even be barefoot anymore - when I am at home, puttering around and doing chores, I have these babies on. I put them in my work tote and slip out of my dress shoes and wear these at my desk. I simply cannot get enough of them.

I will be purchasing more of these Oolala thong flip flops, in different colors. I no longer dread family outings (say, at an amusement park) because I finally have comfortable footwear to walk around in all day, without having to be the wet blanket that continually needs to sit down and ""rest her feet.""

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Sometimes it is so hard to find a loose comfortable tank top. So often they are tight fitting, so I was happy to find the vintage cool loose fit tank top with ettellut hair band.
I ordered this in blue size medium. I normally wear a size small but reviews said this ran small so I figured I would go up one size. The color is a faded blue almost but very pretty. This is a very light weight soft material. It is rather see through so I would suggest maybe wearing it with a sporty sports bra. This tank is a razor back style and very cute.  The color was exactly how it looked in the picture.
I am glad I opted for the medium cause this does appear to run small. This material is very thin, the shirt seems to be stitched well and that it may hold up stitching wise but the material seems so thin I am not sure how long it will hold up. It seems almost like an old shirt you have had for years. I do like that about it cause it makes it very light weight, which is great sometimes in the summer heat.
This came with a complementary hair tie in black. That was really nice it is stretchy and appears to be good quality, and did not stretch out beyond use the first time I used it. I hate hair ties that you can only use once.
I like that this tank is so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, shorts, or even yoga pants and still looks great. You can really even use it as a bathing suit cover if you would like.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"I'm a 36B, which means that I don't need any heavy-duty compression with exercise (I'm a light jogger), and this bra is labeled as a ""medium support bra,"" which I was fine with--I was just hoping to avoid the typical sports bra uni-boob. I'd read the negative reviews from others who brought this bra, in which they noted that the bra didn't provide enough support--which made sense to me, once I saw the fabric in the bra cups, which consists of a fine and breathable mesh material...and my guess is that it wouldn't do such a great job of keeping your nipples from showing through a t-shirt.

Anyway, I do think the bra is well-made, and this company is known for it's quality products, but here's my major complaint and advice to you regarding this bra: if you're a size C cup or smaller, don't bother (or those with C cups should consider the B cup), because the 36B bra that I purchased had huge, loose, silly cups...I put the thing on, and I started laughing at myself in the mirror. It was obvious that, in order for me to fill the bra cups, I needed to almost triple my cup size. Seriously. It was hilarious. I'd say that the only people who would benefit from this bra are those busty ladies looking for a basic, mildly supportive sports bra for the type of exercise that yields little-to-no boob bouncing--like on an elliptical machine, or slow-paced walking. Or perhaps for those busty ladies who don't exercise at all, but just need a bit of lifting and separating...

I'm open to suggestions from anyone who actually wears a 36B (nothing bigger--there are plenty of bra reviews out there from those with larger cup sizes that I can refer to) and can advise on a sports bra that's less than $50, does not lead to uni-boob, and actually provides at least medium support. I also think it would be great if Amazon came up with an option to search and read bra reviews based on your actual size...",0

Its easier than taking your watch into a shop.  I live in a household of 6, so whenever anyone gets a watch I can just adjust it easily.

I think the lack of a calendar function is a huge plus.  Calendar functions never work that well, whenever you have a month that only has 30 days then your calendar is ""off"" and you have fiddle with it.  There are so many other ways for me to know the proper date, like my cell phone and my computer, that I don't need my watch to provide that information.  just the time is fine.

The fit is comfortable.  The red color is pleasing when worn with dressy or dressy casual clothing.

The negatives:
1) the presentation box arrived damaged, which if you were going to give it as a gift would be undesirable.

Why didn't I give it 5 stars:  well, to do that it would have to have something about it that I thought was truly excellent and made it stand out in its field.

That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I had read some reviews saying that this bra ran small and so I ordered TWO band AND cup sizes UP and it was still too small!  Definitely along the lines of a sports bra squish effect.  The sides do come up high.  Glamorise is one the best brands for bras, so I'm very surprised with this one.  The front close idea appealed to me, but look carefully, there are 7 (yes, seven) clasps to do up.  What a pain.  I think if I had ordered 3 sizes up it might be ok.  I won't return it as I'm losing weight, so it might fit better down the road.  Will update review at that time.  If you want a bra that doesn't let you jiggle at all without it being a minimizer and/or without wires, this would be good.

UPDATE:  After very recent gallbladder surgery that left me with a highly tender incision site, I found I couldn't wear any of my regular bras.  I had ordered this one hoping I might be able to tolerate it.  Initially, because it was so tight, I couldn't tolerate this one either.  As I slowly healed, I kept trying the bra.  Due to its elastic nature I was able to adjust this for comfort more than the others.  After about two weeks, much to my amazement, I found the bra had lost its initial snugness and was in fact VERY comfortable!  5 weeks after surgery and this is still the only bra I can tolerate.  The number of clasps in the front turned out to be a bonus as well, because I could choose to leave the bottom clasps undone, adding to the comfort level.  I am still of the opinion that it runs too snug and I'm glad I ordered up.

Take the time to break the bra in!  All bras have a break-in period (in my opinion), and this one is no different.  I'm actually quite happy with it now.",0

Reminiscent of what Lands End sells as a ""Squall Jacket"", or what uniform and corporate wear sellers call a Three Season Jacket.

Water and wind resistant shell.  Microfleece lined body.  Smooth polyester lining in sleeves.  Left hand side, Napoleon style, inside pocket with a hook and loop closure.  Adjustable sleeve cuffs.  Hemline cinch cord with toggles.  Molded plastic chain style, off brand, slide fastener.

Polyester insulation is spilling out due to poor quality stitching.  Item was delivered with a broken main zipper.

I can wear this jacket over just a t-shirt, and expect to stay warm @ 72 degrees Fahrenheit, and no wind.

If it was foggy, or there's a light drizzle, I would have no problem depending on this jacket to go 300 - 500 feet in order to get to my car in the parking lot.

Better garments feature Gore-Tex, Hippora, HyVent, DWR.....this jacket features no technology.  You're just hoping that the polyester does not saturate as you're trying to get where you're going.  You will not be going for bike rides, checking your property's fence line by horseback, riding a motorcycle, playing golf, pier fishing, lap dancing, picking strawberries, calling ducks, or anything else in the rain.

I guess if you name your company, 32Degrees Weatherproof, the customer does not have a reasonable expectation that your garments will keep them dry & warm.

Garment fits tight across the shoulders, back, chest, and arms.  Go 1 size up if you intend on layering.

I've purchased other items from this manufacturer, and frankly, this item was a let down.  It's not warm enough when I need it to be warm.  I put on a few layers, and it is too tight.  I need to stay dry, and I'm sooooo wet.

I wear a size 5 and it fits well. I'm 5'3"" and it fits just right. I'm 5'6"" and it fits just right. I'm 5'4"" and it fits just right. I wear a size 10.5 and it's a little tight on me. I have a small waist and it's not too tight on me. It's a nice little dress. I will buy more colors.Very nice dress.  It is well made and it is very comfortable.  I received a free sample and will see if I can wear it again.  I would definitely buy another one.  I am very happy with this dress.I love these boots!  I have been wearing them for almost 8 months now and I love them so much that I purchased a second pair.  They are very comfortable and look great. ",1
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little ""sticky"" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.",0
