He carries it, mouths it, rolls on it. And THEN he rips it open.
At that point, I take them away because I noticed that he was having difficulty getting strands of the stuffing out of his mouth.

But then he wants another bee! No other toy will do.

I have been giving her these for about a month now,1

My dog is a bully who likes to get down on his own and get up on his own.  This one is a little too small for him.  I ended up going with the larger size.  If you have a bully who will get down on his own, this is a good choice.  I will buy another one for my other dogs. ",1

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,I love this mat!  We put our auto water dispenser on it for our dogs because they tend to dribble all around the water dish and it was constantly wet.  Now the water doesn't sit on my floor it stays contained to this mat.  This mat is silicone so it is flexible and easily washed (can even go in the dishwasher if you choose!).  We have been using this for over a year now and I absolutely would recommend it to anyone wanting to keep that food and water mess contained from those slobbery mutts we love so much.,0
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"This toy is insanely small. The opening was extremely small and I bought this for my tiny female rat and she couldn't even get half her body into this. Any bird that was given this as a toy would have to be very small because this toy is ridiculously small. So small I think a mouse might fit inside it, and that's a big... might fit inside it. Even if my rat had fit inside this, I wouldn't have let her have it because it's made so cheaply. A few bites in the right places and this entire thing would have fallen apart.",0

I think they may be older as the other ones I bought were marketed as current year antlers and the dogs clearly prefer them.

Within 2 days, the bottom part would always start growing an orange slime on it, and I smelled the plastic water-holder part, and it smells like algae (although none is visible).

Even when it was fresh and just poured, the fragrance was absolutely horrendous. It just made cat poop smell poopier, if that's even possible. I'd gag every time I'd walk by. I took a chance and bought this, based on the other reviews and being ""fragrance free"". I am more than happy to say, it truly is. I can't even tell we have a cat. There's zero smell. Zero.

I don't know how long the big ball will last, and I will not leave the toy alone with them ever, or let it get too chewed. PLEASE CUT OFF THE CORDS WITH THE SMALL BALLS! It could mean your cat's life.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Another fun product for my bird to play with. He really likes the bell on the end and he's drawn to the colorful spheres.
The reason I took a star off is that the area where the hook connects to the top sphere is very loose. The whole toy pops off of the hook frequently with very little pulling, sometimes they fall off just trying to hang it in the cage.
In the end the bird still plays with it and he enjoys it, so it's not a super big deal.
Overall, a fun toy for my cockatiel, even if it doesn't stay connected to the hook.",0

After posting the above, I've thoroughly cleaned it, including the pump. Now it works fine. So I'm changing it to 4 stars. The reason it's still not 5 stars is the difficulty getting filters that fit properly. I had to use a spring to wedge it against one side in order to properly seal it. Otherwise the filter is just soaking in the water and not filtering anything.",0

Unfortunately the string doesn't move sporadically in the manner that the dart varies in speed & quickly changes direction. This toy goes one speed, one direction. Pretty boring & predictable, my cat just times the string then grabs it & drags the entire toy around the house with her as it struggles & whirs.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My golden retriever makes an ""mmmmm""sound when she is waiting for me to hand her a favorite treat.  She sat and started ""mmmmmmm"" before I even go the bag open for these goodies!  These are definitely a new favorite. The dogs like the flavor and I like them for two more reasons.  One is that they are soft, so my (greedy) labs don't choke on them.  The second reason is that you can break them into smaller pieces for training sessions and they don't just turn into crumbs like some treats do.  They are perfect for this.

I will be buying more of these! MMMMMMMM!",0

Our Border Collie/ Australian Shepherd mix expends tons of energy running around pushing it all around the yard like crazy, frequently changing directions. Some days it is actually her primary form of exercise, she loves it so much.

As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier.

If he wasn't a smart cat i could understand, but his very clever. He figured out that constantly pawing at my kitchen cabinets will get them to open so he can go inside.

Also during the first two weeks I ran the UV Sterilizer 24 hours a day. After the water cleared I put it on the same timer as the Lights are on, this should help the sterilizer bulb to last longer.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Our Weimaraner was having some trouble with urine leakage.  She wasn't an older dog and occasionally she would urinate while sleeping.  We wanted to try a more holistic approach.  She did not have an infection.  We discovered it was not all that uncommon for female dogs to develp some urinary tract and bladder weaknesses after they are spayed.

We noticed a change in her in about three weeks.  She stopped having accidents and leaks.  She loves to chew the tablets.  They are liver flavored so she thinks they are a treat. When she ran out of them for a few weeks, we noticed she started to have some leakage problems again, so we put her back on the product and so far no problems.  We saw no side effects either.",0

I will say I am either really smart, really dumb or I got the wrong product.  I had the bed setup in like 5 minutes so I am not sure why so many folks are complaining about putting it together, hum.

I got the size large so my two 20lb dogs could share it and it seems to be enough room for the both of them. The material seems sturdy. I did notice the base was real wobbly when I was taking it to the outside but it didn't seem to be an issue when one of my dogs jumped on it but time will tell. I just made sure the bolts were tight. I only rated it a 4 because I am not sure of the frame's sturdiness just yet.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"I can't fathom how the glowing reviews on this product could possibly be real. I just received mine yesterday, just in time to pick my cat up from the vet, after having surgery.

I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

I would NOT recommend buying this carrier. I've had it for 24 hours, and it already looks like it's years old.",0

I did get a free shipping and it was a great deal. I have a 4 month old lab and he's 8 lbs and this is a perfect size for him.

Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either.
We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on.

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

So if you have a larger breed, absolutely go a size (or more) higher.",0

I guess I've used it enough that the hole has stretched and it bounces enough that the water bottle works its way out of the holder and falls. I've tried just taking a half full bottle, and it still falls out. This started out really nice, but now won't work for me.

Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.

Huckleberry tried it out and discovered that the zippers are ""self-healing"" zippers which means that they can be pulled apart and then restored by sliding the tab and slider back over the separated parts of the zipper.  That is how Huckleberry ""opened"" the front door of the crate and met me in the living room when I returned home.  He did not damage the crate but it was disappointing.  Huckleberry is comfortable in his usual crate, a metal one, and goes in readily when I tell him I have to go to work so I was surprised that he tried, successfully, to escape from this crate.

I adore him, and even though it took about three days for him to accept being in here, it's worth it. I would buy this again and again and again.

Bottom line: Yes, it's awesome to have our puppies out and about while traveling, but it only takes one strong hit of the brakes to send them flying, and they will perish. Not worth it.

Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey!

It engages her mind to put in food, peanut butter, or a treat.  She will work on it to get the food out.  When she gives up, to keep it sanitary, you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher.

Further, to have more fun, roll it on a hard floor or driveway and it won't roll straight.  It will give your dog something to chase and pounce on.  Again, this will make life a bit more interesting for them.

I used this brand for my rabbit who lived a healthy 10 years.

There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective.

My larger one gets it first and chews it down and then my smaller one finishes it up (we have plenty of toys, but they always want the toy the other one has right then, just like kids).  This at least keeps them occupied long enough for us to get through a tv episode without crazy dog romper room play all over the couch (and anyone who has the misfortune of sitting on the couch at the time).  Usually their puppy exuberance is cute, but sometimes I like the quiet.

These treats are worth the money and way less messy than trying to fill the nylabone with peanut butter.  Some of them don't snap into place as well as others, but I can usually press those in well enough.  I'll def buy these again.",0

Overall, I think this is a great toy. It's easy to play with, and if it were to get too heavy, it would probably get too much attention.

However, I'm glad I found this. I have used it a couple of times, and it's still fun to play with.

Hint: these peewee pads come with 2 folds, one  in the front and one in the back.  Fold  front or back side under. Invariably, your pet will place its front paws on the pad and pee slightly behind it.  The folded-under part will collect the miss.  After a few days, reverse the pad and fold the other edge under.

The stitching and material must be pretty impressive because my dogs have rolled, wrestled and been nuts with this thing and it is still holding up after 48 hours. I don't think it will last the weekend, but it has already outlasted most of their rope bones and other toys. (Other than chuck it balls, those things are truly indestructible).

I prefer natural-everything but couldn't stand the terrible smell emitted from the litter box that stayed long after scooping. I've been using Tidy Cats clay litter which not only creates a lot of dust but tracks all over my damn house. On a whim, I decided to try this brand of pellets. What I've found is that the optimum freshness occurs when I pour about 2/3 of this product and then 1/3 of the tidy cats on top. The cats mix it together when they bury their treasure, and I haven't had ANY odor issues. I also don't have the excessive tracking anymore. I do agree with another reviewer that stated it would be difficult to see any blood in the cat stool, but that's a chance I'll have to take.

60kg for medium sized dogs
retractable dog leash. Made of environmentally protection material TPE. ABS has a nice rubber grasp that is easy to hold and your hand does not slip off.
you press down on the black button to lock  and release to let it go. 4 meter cord.
the light takes three triple a batteries ( you have to provide those)
the light is very bright which I love. I live in the country so it is dark at night to take out the dog it is nice to have a built in light I do not have to search for. you can also take the light off if you want and hold it in your hand. I like to leave it as one piece so I don't lose it.
really well made hard durable plastic and the end of the leash has light reflector so you can be seen in the dark by cars.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,This is by far the BEST dog toy I have ever invested in.  My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.

So now I carry it on my back like a backpack, it is real easy to get on and off, padded straps are comfortable.
One of the main reasons I bought this carrier was as an emergency device. If we have to evacuate I needed a carrier for my cat that I could manage. Since he is so heavy I knew that I wouldn't be able to carry him for extended periods, so I can wheel him. It is big enough to carry some supplies too, like water and food and a blanket.

From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that the laser movement is super rigid and not natural at all. It basically just moves back and forth along in a circular pattern. You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless.

Minus:  The corded loop does not hold without risking strangling.  I would much prefer something that was adjustable and had a break-away connector to assure that it would not injure my dog(s) if they became desperate to escape the grooming table.  I am currently looking for a replacement for the loop.
All said, I would buy this product again for my 65 pound poodle, especially after her matures enough to stand more steadily for grooming.

I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container.

These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"There is only one pro and con to this harness that matters.

HUGE PRO:  My 100+ pound dog is forced to turn around or stop every time he pulls on the leash because it is connected to the front of the harness.  This means less strain for me and my limbs every time we take a walk.  Previously, I used neck collars and harnesses where the leash ring was on my dog's back.  Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I was choking him.  I think the latter made him feel like he was in control of the walk and not me.

CON: The harness has to be tightened in the appropriate areas (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not as effective.

Aside from that, I like the color of the harness and the contrast with the green and black.  Wish they made more harnesses with this color instead of the ugly lime green that seems so prevalent as an option.",0

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

Also, to keep my dogs from stealing each others' food, I feed them in their crates.  From the dimensions I also assumed (I'll learn to stop assuming) that this feeder would fit comfortably in a large crate with plenty of room for my dog to eat.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,CG,"Maybe if you have a dog with a wide mouth you might need to make a small change. I think it's a good idea to have some guidelines when it comes to how much food you should give your dog. Some people think it's ok to give some food to your dog and others say it's ok to give them a treat. If you have a dog with a long mouth or a sensitive stomach, I think that's fine. If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit. I've found that having a dog with a sensitive stomach is not as important to your dog as having a hard body and to a dog that is sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest.

It soaked through several towels and left a water stain on my beautiful hardwood floors.  I found a few online forums that had the same issue.

The only way I could get him to eat is was to reduce it to powder and sprinkle it on moist foods that he really likes.  Amazon only gives you a certain amount of time to review the product on Vine, so I had to give up and review it.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

My cat took to it fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it helped, but I put a little bit of her old litter brand under the crystals the first time I set it up. I haven't had trouble getting her to change brands in the past.",0

Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions.

Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.

In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

When the pull string is tightened, it cuts off the top 1/3 of the pouch space. The construction is very durable and nicely done. So, if you have a small dog with a small ball, tiny poop bag(s), and tiny treats then this bag is great for you! My dog is a 100lb Wht. G. Shep who likes to fetch a baseball bat and tennis balls. Oh well, my error not Amazon or the seller(description a bit misleading)...I have used the treat bag now and find it great for a lot of smaller treats for my dog and probably better and less costly than the larger treats he was getting. He doesn't care since I break the larger treats to smaller bites. The ball pocket..nah..use it for a bag or clicker. I like this purchase!",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Outstanding product -- I needed a place to feed my skinny cats at their leisure, feed my handicapped kitten, and keep my fat cat on a diet. This works GREAT -- skinny cats love to play all over and jump up to the top house to feed when they are hungry; fat cat has a food timer next to the whole setup to feed her limited diet: she can't jump up and too fat to really want to go into the small house below, and the handicapped kitten gets fed canned food on the first level (she's learning where the food is still). Great solid product... it's rather large (we put in the basement - works out great), easy to put together, If you are a real cat lover - this is definitely a good investment. I have house rabbits too, and once things are set up for them near this condo - I think they will enjoy jumping on it and in the houses.

The fleece covering I'm sure will have to be replaced at some point - its not the highest quality: this is my only ""complaint"" if you can call it that,  but it's good enough. The product came quickly and fully intact.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"This has become an essential tool to restraining my ever growing labrador. She is not out of control by any means, she just gets very excited about her walks and has a very powerful 4 wheel drive system that I cannot compete with.  She was also pulling hard enough that she was choking herself.  The choke collar would be counter productive in those terms, so decided to go with the pinch collar.  We tried a harness, but that only let her pull harder.  I was about to send her to Alaska to become a sled dog. Just kidding, we just need some time to work through it.

The first day I put this on she pushed the limits and yelped a couple times.  Since then, she has learned to respect the collar and we have not had any issues since.  She only goes to the end of the leash and lightly tugs at moments where she is really excited to meet another dog, while still respecting the collar.  Otherwise she has learned to leave some slack in the leash which is comfortable for both of us.  This product has made our walking experience infinitely more pleasurable.  I highly recommend.",0

I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)  I also plan to try a ""top entry"" box for the schnook.",0

The Velcro will not hold up to roughhousing, and if you loose your tags, you're screwed.

I ended up putting this on my cat and putting his rabies tag in it since he is an outdoor/indoor cat. He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.

Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom.

My other dog savored it for a bit longer, but still didn't last quite as long as expected. One thing is for sure, they both definitely enjoyed it. One thing that is a bit confusing about this treat is that a third of them are corn, and corn is a filler that your supposed to avoid when looking for a dog treats/food. Carrots and celery are excellent for dogs, but corn is just a filler with no actual nutrients. I suppose because it it just that- a treat- that it doesn't really matter. The texture and consistency of this treat is about in the middle of a biscuit and a bone. Doesn't keep them busy very long like a rawhide, but it is more than just a one, two crunch of a typical dog biscuit like a milk bone. I think it is a pretty good treat overall, but it is quite pricey considering all of the other longer-lasting and healthier treats out there.

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added.

The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal.

It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.

I have received the replacement but haven't tried it yet as my turtle is in a stock tank outside & its been 105 degrees for past couple of weeks, he/she hasn't needed supplemental heat for now.  I am still going to buy a good, reliable heater to use as daily main heater though, even if this one works.  Also want to mention I did not receive the floating thermometer with either of these heaters.

Edit:  August 6, 2016
I have been using the replacement heater for about a week.  This one does work, however cant comment on longevity.  Very satisfied with seller for prompt replacement of defective heater.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Our little mini-beagle boy is a hyper chewing monster!  Every toy we get him gets destroyed in a matter of days.  (The ones with ""chew guard technology"" last after he's ripped a hole, pulled out the squeaker & stuffing, etc, if anyone's interested LOL)  This ball was his new favorite as soon as he saw me take it out of the box.  It's still his favorite, and he'll go NUTS playing with it all by himself as well as when we throw it for him to fetch.  I got the big one, so he rarely can bite it enough to hear the squeaker, but that's ok.  As for chewing, all he's managed to do is chew off the eyes, but hasn't been able to rip a hole in the ball.  I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally (""litter-ally""!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have a 7 month old kitten, three 6 year olds and one 16 year old cat. My 6 year old Tortie figured this feeder out instantly. As soon as I put the food in one tube and moved to another tube, she was emptying the first tube. Zero challege for her but she seemed to enjoy the act of scooping the food. The other two 6 year olds figured it out after watching my Tortie. She was a better teacher than i was. However, one of them only has one eye. His depth perception is off. So for him i sprinkled kibble between the tubes for him to have to reach between and get. That still slows down his food intake but is a bit easier for him. The rest preffer the tubes. My 16 year old had to start out with no tube, but in a half hour was fine picking treats out of the smaller tube. My kitten eats kitten food as shes still growing so, shes not interested at all in the feeder as it has ""yucky big cat"" food.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"One cannot ask for a better product than this exercise pen.  Although I did not purchase this playpen for a puppy, it served its purpose exceptionally well for a mother cat and her five newborn kittens.  The purpose was to keep them isolated from my other cats while they were being cared for by momma and so that they could not wonder off and become lost prior to their eyes opening.

This playpen is built strong and durable, with two zippered opening on the side.  The netting on each opening can be rolled up and vecroed into place.  The entire top can be zippered off and on, providing easy access to reach your puppy or kittens/cats.  Two sturdy pouches on the side is available for grooming products and accessories.  There is also two net pockets.

One of the nicest attributes of this playpen is;  it can be folded and broken down quickly and stored in the storage pouch that comes with it.  Portable and easily moved by two people, even when erected.  Durable enough to be placed outside to allow your pets to get that fresh air environment.

I highly recommend this product if you're looking for something to assist in isolating your pets during their younger days.  For the price, you will not be disappointed.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Just switched my cat to this food and he really likes it. He's eating it more than the Purina One Beyond he upgraded from. The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.

He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).

Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price!
I noticed that other reviewers said their cats' poop smelled horrible after eating this but Ziggy's poop doesn't smell horrible or strong at all. Probably just depends on your cat I guess. My other cat sneaks some of his food sometimes and it didn't change her poop either. She uses a pee pad because she refuses to use a litter box so I'd definitely notice if her poop smelled stronger!",0

Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

Bottom line: I can't fault the device, really, besides one little design adjustment I'd make.  The litter, however...I wish you could use alternatives.",0

I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that it's made of a durable, tough material that doesn't crack or tear. The smaller size does, however, feel a bit small for a German Shepherd, and the larger size doesn't hold a lot of weight. It's also made of some other sort of plastic, so I don't know why the material feels like it's made of a plastic. I have to give it a 5 for the price. I wouldn't go wrong with this one.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time.",0

You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use.  By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds, and stow it in about 10 seconds.

From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.

My dogs learned to be completely potty trained by 4 months of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go.  The 2 flaps close fairly reliably to keep out the bitter cold.  This ends up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air gets in the house.  Compare that to the amount of air that comes in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside.

Here is the drawback.  My dogs love to grab shoes and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard.  I have to go out regularly to pick up the things they drag out there.  I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig holes in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom.  I also close the door occasionally so the dogs won't bark at neighbors.

Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense.

This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

Some of this I realize has to do with any kind of dietary change,  so I will wait a little longer before giving my final opinion on that.

It does not look too small, but it does not have the same amount of room to move around. I have a 5 pound dog and she is a senior dog.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Normally I have good luck with my purchases. I generally do my research and buy well made products. I bought one of these units and used it successfully for six months. During that time it kept my tropical aquarium at a solid 78F.

One morning, I went to feed my fish and the water was much warmer than normal. I checked the thermometer and it read 90F, luckily my fish were all still alive. I turned the heater knob down to 70 and allowed the water to cool down on its own. After several hours it held 82. I hadn't done a water change in nearly a week so it's not that I let the water level drop.

No big deal, these things happen. Luckily these heaters have a lifetime warranty. I contacted Aqueon by email and received no response. I sent another one a week later, and no response. I couldn't find a phone number for them.

Look, sometimes heaters malfunction. A manufacturer can do all they can to prevent it and back it up with a guarantee. But if they don't stand by their own guarantee or even answer your emails, it isn't a crap product; it's a crap company.

If you are going to buy an Aqueon heater, I recommend the Aqueon Pro instead of this one. They are better units in my experience. Otherwise, have a look at the Eheim Jager, or Fluval offerings.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"When I ordered this I was a little worried about it being a little too large for my dog. It's not the largest I've seen and is a little tight on the dog's chest. It is still a good size for a dog that's a little bit big.

I think it's great for a smaller dog, but the fact that it is a little too big makes it a little more difficult to put together. The metal bars on the sides are very thin, so it's hard to get the hang of. I've had it for about a month now and it's still pretty much in perfect condition. It's a nice size for my dog to get on, but I don't think it's worth the cost of shipping to the store. I've had it for a while now and it's still looking great.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"One thing I find a bit inconvenient about this food is that I have to have a spoon or fork to get it out of the can with.  That's a trade off, because that means it's not all gravy and the cats get more real food for the catfood buck.  I also have to always chop it up because if I don't, my cats just look at it like ""What is this strange thing, mama?  You expect me to do what- exactly- with this?""

After chopping it up, the cats like it just fine.  I wouldn't say they love it.  They don't dance around when I open the can.  It's almost like they can't really tell what it is right off.  Once they realize it is food, they eat it all readily.

It has agreed well with my oldest, sickly cat.  She has breast cancer and a very sensitive tummy.  She hasn't thrown up eating it and she's been acting like she feels very good.  She's been totally curious about everything I do and very active.

I did feed it to several of the crew though, as a topper, and my youngest kitty - 8 months old- threw up all night the 2nd time he ate it.  The first time, he was fine.  The others were all fine so this might have just been a coincidence.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper.  One every walk.  Usually within the first 5 minutes of a 30-45 minute walk.  Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bags and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository.  Two months ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dogs in the world.  Bag juggle??? Not so much.

So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution.  It's durable and can't imagine it will take years for the rubber to stretch out and give way.  I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes.  I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs.  I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"If you want the convenience of buying puppy training pads in bulk and want a great price this is a great choice. These Wee Wee brand pads are by Four Paws, the same company that makes the better quality pads sold at Petco and the other big box stores.

These pads are 22""X23"" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer ""odor control"". They work very well.

Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.

I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were ""improved"". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.

In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.

That first Winter one of the pups had a bad back knee that tended to go out when she put pressure on it. When it did it obviously hurt, since she gave out a yelp..  So, she decided to stop climbing stairs.  Thinking she might need ACL surgery, I took her to a vet well known for that.  He said, nope not her ligament: bad joint (thin collagen). And he said it was a breed characteristic.  He prescribed this supplement.  Took care of it pretty quick and soon she was bounding up and down the stairs, jumping on and off the sofa and when she was tall enough, my bed.  Since the vet said bad knees are a breed characteristic, I have both dogs on a half pill a day.  The pain went away fairly quick, maybe a couple of weeks.  I keep them on it hoping to stave off arthritis in their later years.  And, best of all, they think it is a treat!  UPDATE:  As of Jan 2015 both girls no longer pups are still doing great.

I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside.

When I bought the PetFusion Cat Scratcher Lounge I worried a little bit whether spending this kind of money would be evidence that I've turned into a Cat Lady. Well, maybe I have... but at least I know I did not waste a cent. Because from the first moment that Shaka met this ""lounge"" (as you see in the video) she has claimed it as her own. It's a good thing that the other cat thinks it's ""meh,"" because Shaka would defend this with a temper tantrum.

Yes, it's on the large side. It's probably as big as some people's side coffee tables. That's fine for us because it has becomes the cat's regular perch, and (for a small cat) she stretches out very comfortably. And then she indulges in some dainty ripping-apart-of-cardboard as she scratches to her little heart's delight.

1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

I'm so glad I did the research on rawhide before harming my dog, and the sweet potato is the only way to go.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,This product is great and works well. It is thick enough to make it hard to throw. If you want to throw a tennis ball then the plastic part should be strong enough to go through it. It is a perfect size for my dogs and is perfect for them. I have 2 dogs with medium to large chests and they have never had problems with this ball. I just put it on them and they go to their feet. It is very easy to put on and take off. The only thing I wish I could do is let them just sit on it and it would be a good thing for them to not have to do that. I would definitely recommend this product. This is the best dog bed I have found. It's lightweight and is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for the last 10 years. It's well made and the only thing that bothers me is the fact that it is a little hard to put on but that's not a problem with the other dog beds I have used. My dogs go to the bed when they're hungry and this one is a little bit tougher on them. This is the only catnip my cat doesn't like.,1
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

I hope you find this review helpful and think if you just give Cat's Pride Fresh and Light a try you will never buy any other brand again!",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"We used to run a small pet store with a lot of dogs and this harness worked great. It is so small that it is a bit difficult to put on, so it is not necessary to put it on. It is a bit on the loose side and is still quite comfortable for the dog. It is also a bit heavier than I had hoped and it is a little heavier than I expected. It does not have a lot of straps on it, but it is very comfortable for the dog. I would highly recommend this harness.I've had these for about a month now and have had a couple of complaints.  They do not work at all.  We bought a larger size and found that they are a bit too small for my 18 lb. Yorkie.  I will be replacing them all.  I guess I'll have to get another one.  We just have to figure out how to keep them from getting in the way of our dogs.  I'm not sure how much of this is because we don't have a large dog.  The sizing seems to be a little on the tight side.  However, the size fits our 18 lb. Yorkie perfectly.  She is a bit smaller than we expected",1
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

All in all though it's a good harness, made well, and most importantly secure enough that it would be really hard for a dog to get out of it.",0

I have the most trouble with the plastic part on my dog's neck.  I just put it on him and he's not on it anymore.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"a lot of the reviews say the consistency is too dry, i was a bit hesitant to buy it after reading that... but i went ahead and purchased this type because i was on a budget and its $10 cheaper than the venison and sweet potato pack. received it today and both of my dogs devoured it. i was feeding them chicken soup for the puppy lovers soul wet food mixed with 1/4 cup dry chicken soup dog food (was still using up the puppy cans, both dogs are on to adult food now) and that stuff smelled like canned dog food. nothing special. they ate it and it didn't make them sick... but i wanted something better and preferably grain free. ran out of the wet the other day before making this purchase and substituted with a scoop of pedigree puppy formula wet food and pretty much within 5 minutes after finishing eating my boy was throwing up. scrapped that can. this stuff smells ALMOST like human food, you can see the potato chunks in it, wich i didn't think were too overbearing, my dogs love potatoes so its not a problem anyways. so far, so good. its been about an hour and neither one has puked.

as for the dry consistency, its not really an issue for me since i just use the wet to entice them to eat their dry food. my boy dog will not eat plain dry kibbles, period. he really seemed to enjoy this stuff.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,4,CG,"Two weeks ago I adopted a kitten and she was a puppy. She was a small baby and we had two small dogs. I thought she would get the treat, but it was too small. She had no interest in chewing on it. I placed it on the floor and she chewed on it. I ended up going to the vet and got the dog food and she has not been able to chew on it. She seems to like it too. She will play fetch with it and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a puppy. Pros:
-Good for small dogs
-Great for puppies
-Light weight
-Doesn't seem to irritate your dog at all

Cons:
-No texture at all
-You have to put the bag on top of the bed to get the bag to come off. I have not tried this product in my dogs home. My cats love these. My dog is about 20 lbs.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I put this on a large 6 month old kitten, who is already quite muscular, but with all the litheness of a kitty with especially slick, longish hair. I successfully put smaller versions on two smaller kittens, who did not have the strength to object quite so vigorously. This is another drawback of this rig. If the cat gets in in his head that he does not want this gizmo put on him, it becomes very difficult to attach it. Two grown men, both with good histories with wrangling cats, tried to put this rig on my 6 month old male, and it was quite a chore. There are two clips which fasten beneath the cat's tummy, which are so small, it becomes very difficult for a normal adult to open them. It is also difficult to connect the two halves, when they are laying against a cat with moderately long fur, which insists on getting in the way. These noisome connections are at the most inconvenient location, when a single person has to hold down an uncooperative kitty, and connect them at the same time. You need four hands at least.

So, that is two strikes against this design for large, energetic cats. After two grown men believed they had successfully harnessed our feline Houdini, he wriggled out of it in about 2 minutes. One second it was on, and the next, it was off. It was that fast. Makes me want to go into business to design a better kitty harness.",0

1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"We've had to switch brands multiple times when buying bully sticks.  The last one we loved but they are out of stock and no ETA on when more will be in.

These seem to be larger on average than others we have purchased, like someone picked the best ones ahead of time.  That was nice since even at the pet store, you might not have enough to pick that many choice ones.

But more importantly, they are the darker color my dog seems to prefer.  Some brands started out this way but then started selling packages were the sticks were more golden in color, and my dog didn't like those much.  I don't know if it's a change in how they process them, or what animal it comes from, but the dark ones seem to be the best.

I have a male Samoyed and when he's in the mood he'll reduce one of these by half or less in pretty short order, maybe 30 minutes or so, then finishes the entire thing later.  When they are good he'll even eat up any small pieces.  He's a big dog at almost 70 pounds though, and only water buffalo horns and bones last any length of time.

I've seen many reviews on many bully sticks wanting 'odorless' sticks.  I've not noticed them to be overly stinky but, it is a dried piece of animal, it does smell a little bit.  I don't even notice it unless I'm sitting by my dog, though.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This is a good dog-seat solution.

PROS: My 11 pound mini pinscher fits perfectly into it - it is big enough for her to lie down too. The seat can be hung high enough for her to look out the window, or set low (almost on the car seat) for extra stability. The fact that the upper straps are attached to the frame halfway along the side walls and not at the very front means that the full space of the box is available to the dog (i.e. the front wall doesn't cave in).  The clip attaches to the god collar or harness and is adjustable in length. The cover is removable and washable.

CONS: the frame is metal and the cover very thin, so there is no padding whatsoever if the dog falls against the side of the box or wants to rest her head on the rim. For some strange reason the short strap that clips onto the dog collar/harness is not looped in/permanently attached, i.e. if you try lengthen that strap to the maximum to give your dog more freedom of movement it simply comes out and you have to maneuver it back in. It also came with a HUGE (and I mean huge) clip for attaching to the dog collar/harness, so i had to replace it with a smaller one.

I love it. I have a German Shepherd and a Shih Tzu. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that they don't have to worry about the front part of the collar getting loose. The collar has a really nice reflective ring on the front which makes it shine a bit more.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy!

I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have.

In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy).",0

Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience.

We had a couple of cats through the years when kids were little, and of course, I did the clean-up. So secretly, I was not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what was in the future. Lots of mess.  I don't mind the scooping.  To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor.  There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.

We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.

I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.

This thing is well-engineered:

Most of the litter stays in the box.
It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean.
Very easy to clean.
Anti-microbial without any chemical odors.
Holds a boatload of litter.
Tucks into a corner.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.

At first I was happy with the quality of the stroller including the wheels (actual tires with inner tubes) and the ability to easily lock the stroller in place. It also gave us the freedom to go on longer walks. However as reported by another reviewer, despite the stroller saying ""up to 70 pounds"" this was completely inaccurate. As such, my dog would take up the entire stroller which put strain on some of the mesh panels which then began to unravel. Since the stroller did give us the freedom to move about I kept it and made repairs every time a section came undone though over time the separation in the fabric occurred all over the stroller and not just where he would lean. The stroller had major patchwork from all my repairs but I was going for function over looks. However, with continued use the frame became a quite wonky though still usable but the final nail in the coffin occurred today when one of the back tires broke off while we were using it.

He was freaked out by a noise, was spinning in circles, slipped out and ran away - ran around a huge block, me in futile pursuit (he runs like a greyhound,) crossed 2 busy streets twice (Yucca and Wilcox) and almost went to Hollywood Blvd. Somehow he survived and this story has a true Hollywood ending... apparently a taxi driver had just let out a fare and my little guy jumped in - only way he could've gone in was on his own.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.",0

sad to say, but I have to take down 2 star... these toys are awesome little things that my dog loves to throw in the air and catch, but the squeakers inside are horrible! The squeakers inside last about an hour, but they never squeak again... they're very poorly made. The squeaker inside has two parts and the little thing that makes the squeaker squeak always slides out. Then the squeaker part always gets smashed within an hour that my dog gets bored of it. That's the only problem with this toy which is kind of a big deal since the whole point is for it to squeak!

This collar has features that I really appreciate.  It has a vibrate and a beep as well as the shock feature.  I've actually only used the shock once and that was when he got out and was running around in the road.  I tried snacks, toys and everything else I could think of.  I was terrified he was going to run in front of a car so after the beep and vibrate didn't work, I used a very light shock.  It scared him and he ran inside.  You can pick the intensity that is used.  I just used a 2.  For other issues, like his crazy barking, we use a beep.  That usually gets him to stop, if he doesn't we use the vibrate feature.  I have the vibrate turned up because he doesn't like it and he knows he needs to stop if he gets buzzed.  The beep works great as an attention getter.  He knows when he hears it that he needs to look at us to see what he needs to do.  I'm very happy that we bought this.  I was completely against a ""shock collar,"" but we really just use the other features on it for training purposes and with some patience and persistence, it has really worked.",0

One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.",0

The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"This is a generous portion of cat food with a lot of higher quality ingredients compared to other types of cat food. Primarily, the first ingredient is actual chicken and it includes taurine. It also does not include grains of any kind and, as anyone knows about cat nutrition, grains are not a part of anything a cat needs in its diet. They are junk food and fillers so the primary selling point of this product is that it provides what your cat needs to be healthy without things which it does not need or that can damage its health. So, I'm very pleased with the ingredients list for this product, though I will note that one pays a premium price for the quality.

I can't speak to whether or not the nutrition is as good as the ingredients list indicate it should be, but I can say my cat throws up less after eating this than some other types of food. I can also say that she tends to rapidly lose interest in dry food that I feed her and has held interest in this longer than other types of dry food. I don't know if she's finding it more appetizing (possible, since it has a strong smell and she seems to like stronger smelling food) or if not having digestive issues after eating it makes her favor it.

In terms of value, if my cat continues to eat this up over time, I will keep buying it because, though it may be more expensive, if she will actually eat all of it and I don't have to throw out uneaten food, it'll save me money in the long run.",0

It is cotton so I don't know if it will break down over time but I wouldn't hesitate to replace it since it's a great price.

Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system.

I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell.
I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage.
I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box.
Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing.

My kitten, now a year old, has had an ongoing issue with extremely dry stools even though he eats 1/2 wet 1/2 dry diet (wish it were all wet food) and apparently doesn't drink enough water. Anyhow, he loved the taste of the other two as I'd just put some on his food dish and he'd lick it up so there was a concern he wouldn't like the natural version. Thankfully he loves this just as much crying for it as soon as he sees me reach for the tube.

As for effectiveness, neither of the other two seemed to help soften much although I feared giving him too much as I didn't want him to become dependent upon it for bowel movements.  It does make me feel better giving him the natural version. We'll see if it helps soften his stool as thus far even giving him about two half inch servings a day hasn't seemed to help :-( And, I really hope none of the ingredients are bad for kitties...

It's a nice size for a large dog.

We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 inches tall, so he was a bit small for this bedding.  It's definitely a bit large for him.  We have to get the bedding from the fabric and we have to get it off the dog.  It's also a little heavier for him than other beds we have.

It's a nice size for a small dog.  We've had this bedding for about a year and it's still in good condition.  It's a little tight on the dogs neck but it's not too tight for the large dog.  The material is very soft and it's easy to tear off.  I've used it on my dogs all over the house and it looks nice and it's a little big for them.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this bedding and I think it will last a long time.",1
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,2,CG,"Too many cons:
1- I own a bunch of these and they are all around my house.
2- I don't know if I will ever have to replace them, but it is pretty expensive to do so.
3- I am very lazy. I have to spend money on expensive products and a lot of time on the phone. I can't afford to waste money on this.
4- I have to spend money on items that are ridiculously overpriced.
5- I have to spend money on something that is basically junk.
6- I have to spend money on a product that is really just a trick that doesn't work.

7- I have to spend money on things that are completely useless.

8- I can't afford to buy a new cat.

9- I have to spend money on items that are completely useless.

10- I can't afford to buy a new pet.

My cats are not as stubborn as they used to be and are not crazy about these things.

I don't know if I should have paid more attention to these things, but I do like that they are made in the USA and that they have the same quality as the ones in China.

I don't know if I should have purchased these at all, but I think I will.I bought this because I wanted a pet door",1
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I really like this product.  My 9lb pomeranians fit compactly within.  It looks a bit snug for them to sit up but it's workable.  The product is very versatile and we've already used them a few times.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have 6 cats and this is the most popular treat yet.  I have to be careful to be fair and divert the more agressive cats or they will fight over them.  My old cat is the one with the bad coat but it has been improving very well with these.  She also gets a joint supplement one.  Her coat is filling out nicely and she is looking a lot better, much less ragged.  These don't bother any of my cats, even my puke queen who throws up with every new thing.  I've had NO episodes of tummy upset with any of the cats.
They are little fish shaped treats, brown, and feel moist to the touch.  I would suggest having another bag of treats nearby that they can have extras of, because they want more than one. They are only supposed to eat one treat each a day, but my cats got in my desk drawer and drug the treat bags out.  This one was the one they wanted- they chewed a HOLE in it and got a few of the treats out.  They were all ok though.  They didn't get the whole bag, but just a few, I guess 5 or 6 maybe they managed to chew out of the bag, which is a heavy plasticy-foil bag with a zip top.  The top held well so they just tried to get in the bag.  IF the bag had been paper or a bag like party treats came in, I've no doubt they would have ate the whole bag.

The material is very durable and I would recommend it for dogs with heavy hands.Great for the price.  I have a German Shepherd and a medium-size dog.  I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.  I have a very tough chew toy and this is my second one.  It was very well made and was easy to put together.  I would recommend this for a dog who has a lot of loose hair or loose skin.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a large dog.

One thing that I would like to note is that the description for this collar is very misleading.  There are a few things I can tell you about the collar, but I will be giving it a 5.  The description says that it is ""Upper-collar, upper-collar, lower-collar, dog",1
Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!",0
Pet_Supplies_5,4,CG,"Let preface my review by stating that I am very disappointed in this product. I have used this product before and had no issues with it. The plastic part on the back is very thin and it does not hold up well to the biting. This is a very thin plastic with no edge. I have to leave it on the floor and it goes out of the way. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this product. This is a great product for dogs that need to be chewed up, but they can't chew it up!  This is a great product for dogs that have chewed it up too. We bought this for a puppy that had chewed up a huge chunk of his front teeth. It's a bit flimsy, but it's sturdy enough to keep him from chewing on it. It's a bit on the smaller side for the size of a small dog. It's a little stiff for a small dog, but it's worth it for her to chew on it. The only downside is that it's not very easy to clean, and I find that it doesn't hold up well for her to chew on. I don't use this product on my dogs, but I do recommend it. I got this for my dog and she loves it. I bought it for her to be able to lay on a couch.",1
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!",0

I did get a free item for review purposes and so far the cats love it.  They are able to go outside on it and it is well made and does not leak.  I don't know if it will last as long as it did before I switched to this litter box but it is definitely worth the money.My dogs love this toy!  They play with it until they are bored, then they chase it and play with it for hours!  It's a great toy!  It's very sturdy and sturdy for our dogs.

After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.

I have a 3 1/2 year old newly adopted rescue puggle who take way more after his beagle mother and has beyond an impeccable nose and sensing abilities.

I was not happy about this - not only was he uncomfortable, but so was I. This morning I was delivered the Gentle Leader headcollar and went home for lunch to test it out ..... WOW!!! Even after reading all the great reviews here, I seriously did not expect it to work on the first try, but was so very pleasantly surprised. No difficulty putting on, my puggle, Chewy, seemed comfortable with it on (although on occasion he did paw at it since he is not used to wearing something around his muzzle area) but did not show any sign of discomfort. With the first few steps he was beginning to walk by my side or a tiny bit behind me and followed my lead versus just running off after any/all random scent trails! I still allow him to follow all the scent trails he sniffs, but we do it at an acceptable rate versus having the 'zoomies' towards all the scents. This is just our first walk in the first day too!!

I give it to her every day by breaking up the amount into two servings so, that she can enjoy it in the morning, and in the evening.

This supplement has kept her very healthy, her coat is very shiny, and her appetite is very good.  My ferret is very small and this has kept her weight on because it provides her with a healthy appetite.  My vet recommended this item to me during my first visit because she is so small, and keeping weight on her is very important.

What I love most about this item is how crazy my girl gets when she sees the tube, she does a cute little dance, and fluffs up her coat.  She could be in the other room and I will tap the tube in my hand and she will come running.  This is a great company that makes great products and has kept my ferret healthy. This Vitamin Supplement has a good list of vitamins for their overall health.  Most of all the taste seems to be very appealing to my girl.

I would recommend this item to any ferret owner as a supplement and also if you are having problems getting your ferret to eat or maintain weight, give her or him some of this prior to their meal and their appetite should be good to go in about 10 minutes or so.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.",0

Only at night would they eat a TINY tad, only enough to basically sustain life out of starvation. One of the puppies started looking thinner and mind you, these ""puppies"" are already between 60-65 pounds each so I know they had be hungry. I started doing my own research on the food to try to see if others were experiencing this behavior with their dogs also.

I returned the last bag I had purchased from the pet food store today and replaced their food with ""Zignature"" limited ingredient dog food and let me tell you, these dogs tore it up!!

Blaming a rowdy dog for destroying the cot, saying it is not sturdy etc is just some of the nonsense I have read about this cot. I got my original one over a year ago from Costco and placed it on our back deck. Now let me tell you, I live in the mountains where it's a hard life for anything outdoors, constant rain, heavy snow loads and cold temperatures really take a beating on thIngs up here. I also have 7 rescue dogs that share this cot of varying sizes from a 13 pound min pin mix to a 65 lb rottie mix. I rescued my min pin mix from the streets at 6 months old and one she felt at home she decided it was her mission to eat as much stuff as possible. She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,I probably should give this 5 stars because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one was damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;),0

Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

I have had to use a different clasp on the top because it is hard to see the clasp on the collar.  I have tried other brands, but they all seem to have just the same problem.  I am having trouble adjusting the collar because it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I was worried about my cat getting too close to the collar and getting it to go in the air.  It is very easy to adjust and I would recommend it.  I have a very hard time getting my cat to use it.  I would recommend this collar for a very hard and experienced cat.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I recently purchased the ""ultra"" model on Amazon along with the forever litter tray and crystals.  I haven't used the Forever litter tray yet (the Scoopfree Ultra came with one tray/crystals so I'm using that first.)  The scoopfree ultra machine seems very sturdy and I'm very satisfied with my purchase so far.  I really like the counter that keeps track of how many times the machine is used, at first I thought it was an unnecessary feature, but it really helps to know the cats are actually using it and when to replace the cartridge.  I have two cats and at first they saw the machine and were scared of it.  I mixed in some of their old litter and took away the old litter box completely and I'm happy to report they are both using it!  I'm keeping the hood off for now, I'm concerned that they feel too intimidated if they are enclosed inside the box, I will put it back on in the future when they are more comfortable with the new machine.  When my item was delivered, it was not sent in a shipping box with padding, only in the manufacture's box with a label slapped on.  Needless to say the box was beaten and looked taped together when it arrived.  In hindsight, I probably would recommend buying the box at a local pet store instead of online, luckily I've never had to return anything to amazon, but it seems like it would be a big hassle if the unit arrived broken or the cats decided not to use it.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"My dog has had skin bacteria issue on and off for a while because of his age and immunity.  I read the reviews on this item and had tried the Zymox brand for his ear yeast infections and this stuff performed pretty miraculously.

The shampoo is amazingly rich and thick.  It smells good and does a much better job than following up my dog's bath with a vinegar rinse which is what I was doing before to get rid of the skin issues.  However, my sensitive dog hated, really hated the vinegar rinse and it would stress him out so much that I had to find another solution.  I tried this and he was pleasantly surprised as was I.  This gets to the deep areas beneath the coat easily and doesn't just sit on the surface of the skin.  I followed the instructions about letting it sit for 3-5 minutes and I let it set for five and more.  The shampoo is easy to rinse out and really leaves his skin feeling soft.  After his bath, he does not show the normal irritation of moving from one position in the house to the next.  He seems more settled and not trying to escape the itch.  After his bath, I inspected the areas and they were almost as pink as the rest of his normal skin.

But don't be fooled!  Bacteria and fungus invasions are nothing to play around with.  I am giving him a bath every other day for three weeks and washing his bedding every single day and it is making a difference.  This shampoo is great and I have purchased the Zymox coat conditioner for after bath rinsing.  I will post more later as progress goes...",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"While our daughter is serving time in the US, we've tried a lot of different foods and we've found that the best thing for her to get through her food bowl is to go to the bathroom and look at the food in her bowl. If she doesn't like the food, she'll eat it.

Our daughter also loves the chicken and rice dishes. She has a tendency to just eat the chicken and rice dishes and that's fine because she loves the food. She doesn't like the chicken and rice dishes, but she does like the chicken and rice dishes.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"First off, let me just say we spoil our dog.  I'm sure most people do.  For our little Maltese, we've tried a variety of dental chews.  His favorite treats are Greenies.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I have an anxious dog.  His anxiety is not such that my Veterinarian has recommended ""serious"" drugs for management, but I do like to try out the over-the-counter offerings like this one with him.

The big downside of this nutraceutical is palatability... neither of my dogs liked the taste and would ""eat around it"" when it was in their food.  I could easily ""pill"" them with it, but that's a hassle and I don't think it's particularly helpful to force things on an already anxious dog.  They would not eat it even when it was combined with peanut butter or had cheese wrapped around.  They are, admittedly, kind of picky, but that made this product unsuitable for us.

The ingredients are
Active Ingredients (Per Tablet)
Chamomile - 150mg
Passionflower Powder - 100mg
GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) - 100mg
L-Theanine - 50mg
L-Tryptophan - 33mg
Thiamine (Mononitrate) - 4mg
Ginger Root Powder - 2.5mg
Inactive Ingredients Beef flavor, brewers yeast powder, liver powder, magnesium stearate, cellulose, silicon dioxide, stearic acid, thiamine mononitrate.

These are interesting and not ones I have seen combined before.  Theoretically, the L-tryptophan and L-theanine, in particular, could have calming effects, although the research jury is still out on everything from dose to actual efficacy.  I do think this comes under the heading of ""mostly harmless,"" although you should always check with your Vet about anything with which you plan to attempt to treat your pet long term.

This is certainly affordable, compared to a few of the other popular over-the-counter remedies.  Be aware that it is very common for it to take 6 weeks or longer before you see effects from any nutraceutical.  Cautions on this product indicate that it hasn't been proven safe for pregnant or lactating bitches, and that it should be discontinued 5 days before any general anesthesia is administered.",0

It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4).

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I got this in the August Blockhead Box (a dog subscription box).  I have the ""large"" version and, for the record, my dog is an 83-84 pound Rottweiler who is super destructive.

This lasted my dog longer than a lot of cloth-covered toys (I hesitate to call it ""plush"" because it's not particularly soft and doesn't have stuffing).  As in, like five minutes.  Part of the reason was she had a bit of trouble picking it up, but I'm not blaming that on the toy, I'm blaming it on my dog.  She kept trying to pick it up by the middle, while one of her feet was holding the outside part down...anyway, she did eventually get it up.

My dog has the uncanny ability to find the weak point in any toy.  In this case, it is the embroidered KONG logo.  She started gnawing on that after a few minutes and I did eventually have to take it away because she put a few small holes in it near the logo.  For what it's worth, she did LOVE this toy and was sad to have it taken away, and it held up pretty well to tugging.  Also, although there are squeakers, she really didn't squeak this too much (for once, much to my relief...).

In the end, maybe this is not for the heaviest of chewers, but I have no doubt it would work for some dogs (like my last Rottie, who was very gentle with toys).  The large is appropriate for large breed dogs.  Although my dog is on the small side for a Rottie, I would feel comfortable giving this to a dog 20 or 30 pounds heavier, as well.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"This took my cat less than a day to figure out. So that is good. But the design is not 100% perfect. I'm glad the base is more stable than the first Catit Food Tree. But still, it could have a bit more weight to be more bottom heavy.
The problem I quickly noticed is that kibble pieces can become trapped in places, and a cat can't get them out. I've attached pictures. Pictures #1 and #2 show where kibble pieces get stuck. If you have a declawed cat, there is no way they can get those pieces. A cat with claws will even have trouble. A human has to stick their fingers in and dislodge the kibble pieces.
Picture #3 shows a kibble piece that perfectly fits inside the little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. (letting you know the degree of difficulty on the rotating disc). That kibble piece is also stuck, and a human has to dislodge it. You don't need a little circle that says 1, 2, or 3. Food gets stuck there.
These areas where kibble can get stuck, will be frustrating to a cat who is trying to get it.

I have also discovered that the middle level with the rotating disk does not lock in place. If I set it to 3 (the hardest setting with the smallest holes) my cat can EASILY rotate it to level 1 (the easiest setting with the biggest holes). What is the point of having different settings to make the puzzle easier or harder, if it does not lock in place?

But everything considered,  I guess I do like Catit Senses 2.0 Food Tree, and my cat is doing well with it so far.

They go in, dig around awhile, do their duty and then they spend a more than usual time scratching around in the litter box before they exit. We, at first, though that it was because they were having a difficult time covering up their duty with the light litter. We were wrong. We have two litter boxes downstairs (and two upstairs) sitting side-by-side so we performed an experiment on the two downstairs litters. We put light litter in the left hand box and clay litter in the right. In the morning we filled one litter with their usual clay based litter and one with this light litter. The cats used them all day. At the end of the first day the box with the light litter was used about 30% more than the clay. On the second day the light litter box was use almost exclusively. There were only a couple of pee clumps in the clay litter. On the third day we reversed the positions of the two litter boxes. Now they were clay left and light right. Only the right box (light litter) was used all day. The clay litter box was clean! Both upstairs clay litter boxes were pretty much unused except for some pee. I have since seen the cats standing in line waiting to use the light litter box while the clay litter box was being left unused and completely vacant. Darndest thing I've ever seen. Now we're putting clay in the bottom and light on top until the clay is gone. From then on, light litter ONLY.

We raise Goldendoodles, and I had HIGH hopes that my puppies would love this as I've been researching high quality dog foods.... well it doesn't matter how high the quality is supposed to be if the puppies/dogs won't eat it! NONE of my 5 adult dogs or 12 puppies ages 2-8 month old puppies would eat it straight. I've been having to mix in meat drippings to get them to eat any of it and it caused SEVERE digestive upsets in ALL my dogs!

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"FINALLY, I found a cat litter that's worth it's weight.  I live in a very small space, have one cat but *hate* kitty litter peppered all over my floors. I also dislike coming into my cozy little living space to smell cat litter dust or worse...cat waste.  This litter is finally the one I will stick with, after changing litter brands with every bag for almost a year.  This litter tracks significantly less and smells significantly less than any clay or recycled litter I've used.  I still have to tidy up the floor mat outside of her box after a couple days but it actually stays on the cheap small mat! I was worried I was going to have to buy a $40 special mat to catch the litter she throws out of the box like confetti.

It also doesn't smell. At all.  I have a sensitive sense of smell and I can't smell it when I walk in the condo, even though the box is 10 ft from the door.  I used all 5 lbs. in the box at once to help encourage her to cover her waste (laziest cat ever) and it's keeping the odor down very well.  I don't attempt to scoop the urine out but I do scoop the poo about every 2-3 days.  I've had the same litter in the box for 2 weeks now and no smell and the cat hasn't protested!  There is still plenty of dry litter for covering in there still as well - quick absorption.

I give this product 5 stars, despite it's higher cost, because it's not stuck to the bottom of my feet and it doesn't smell like litter or cat pee in my house.  Is that too much to ask from other litter companies?! I think not.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Update August 8, 2012:

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

Original Post:

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I was contacted by this vendor to provide a review in exchange for a discounted price.  That said,  I'm glad I purchased this toy.  My male cat especially goes crazy over it.  My female cat hasn't bothered with it as much but hasn't been feeling well in general.

Height/Size is good and rope is wound and secured tight to post.  Base is solid and stands tall when cats scratch.  As my pictures show, my male cat has long legs and body and this post height fits him fine. Assembly is easy, only requiring a philips screwdriver.  My young niece and nephew had fun assembling it for the cats who started using it immediately.  The feather is a nice tease and so far still in tact after a few days of use. My cats seem to like the course texture.  From the pictures you'll see the cat playing with it in different rooms as we moved around looking for the right spot. Placing it where he stalks helps keeps him from scratching the carpets and furniture. My cats do well when we stimulate them with toys preventing boredom. The quarter circle shape fits nicely in corners or along walls.  We already had a post  with a square base and spring with pom-pom, which I don't like as much as this post.  I've never seen my cat go for the Pom-pom but the feather gets them going!  Having more in the house is not a problem, one upstairs, one downstairs.

Two items I would like to see the vendor improve would be including felt pads underneath so it doesn't scratch my wood laminate floor (I will add some felt furniture pads underneath).  Second, increasing the post diameter at least one inch. Currently it's under three inches and a little narrow.",0

INGREDIENTS: Made ingredient is BEEFHIDE vs rawhide. Rawhide is the inner layer of the hide of any cleft-hoofed bovine livestock. Beef-Hide is premium rawhide made from cows raised for consumption. So, this is just another form of rawhide that is from cows as opposed to just any animal with a cleft hoof.  The Healthy hide rawhide has some extra potato starch, salt, soybean oil, vitamin E (100 IU), and preservatives.  The Healthy Hide sticks have almost ZERO SMELL.

The Healthy hide sticks come with 20 sticks but they smell like plain old rawhide and my dog just leaves it lying around.

Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.

For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...

The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.

Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!

And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake...",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Our Vet recommended these Pill Pockets for our 4 kittens when we switched from using a topical flea medication to a pill form.  When we got home, I placed my order and I was excited to see how this would work!  When this product was delivered, I quickly tore open the package to see what it looks like and exactly how it smells.  Well, I was bummed when all the pill pockets were smashed together instead of being individually separated into a pill pocket form.  However, I did make it work by tearing off a piece, rolling it into a ball and then I placed the pill inside of the ball I made.  I would have returned it but, I did not want to wait any longer since the kittens were overdue on this medication. As for how it smells, it really does not smell like a Salmon flavor to me anyways.

Out of the 4 kittens, 3 loved the pill pockets and wanted more!  Each kitten had their own pill because of their weight so, I kept them separated.  My first kitten, loved the pill pocket, she swallowed it with the pill included.  I was very happy and thought this would be a breeze! Not so much, LOL!  The second kitten ate the pill pocket but, he spit out the pill so, I tried it again and the same thing happened.  The exact same thing happened with the third kitten! When I got to the fourth kitten, she ran away after taking one sniff of the pill pocket.

So, 3 kittens out of 4 love the pill pocket taste but, where smart enough to know that there was a pill inside. Needless to say, it was a very funny experience!  Not to mention what it took us to finally get them to take their pill!",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have attempted to use a bark collar 3 times and sent them all back for various reasons. This one is perfect. The charging system is excellent.  It has a rubber flap that stays secure when the collar is on. Many other don't provide this simple flap. The available setting, number 2, gradually increases the shock until the dog reacts. It is very humane because my dog knows how far she can take it. It allows her to still guard but with a little grumble, just enough to get her point across but stops her from the loud bark. She knows that when she has it on she is off duty.  She calms down immediately when it's on.  It did take consistent use, like any training, but I saw results within days.  I have used it now for 3 months and putting it on her is no big deal. The most important thing is that I don't feel guilty about using it.  She learned very quickly and only got shocked a few times until she understood her limits. It was hard to hear her yelp when it shocked her but I stuck to it and honestly, she learned quickly and the result is amazing. She never gets shocked any more when I put it on her.  It just helps her relax and keeps her in check. As long as she has it on the insane barking at delivery people, strangers, dog walkers, kids on skateboards, and other barking dogs has ceased.

The downside is that it's fairly large and I hate seeing that big box on her neck. But there is not getting around this. They are all pretty ugly. I tried a smaller one once. It looked better but didn't have enough power to work efficiently. Te only suggestion I have is to offer a few different colors instead of black.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"My cat, Raoul purchased this during a nocturnal shopping spree. We got him his own credit card with the hope that occasional nighttime internet shopping would entertain him while the rest of the household slept. This works out pretty well most of the time as he usually purchases small inexpensive items such as cans of tuna, bags of Pounce, and electronic dog whistles.

One night, however, he watched&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelia/dp/B0036SLOP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelia</a>&nbsp;on Amazon Instant Video and he became extremely interested in flying.  For a few weeks he would climb up on to a tall bookcase and spring, legs outstretched, usually on to the sleeping dog, but sometimes at any unsuspecting passerby.  He must have eventually become bored with free flight because this Cat Airplane arrived one day. Raoul set upon assembling the cardboard pieces and although he was quite methodical, it was beyond his physical ability to complete the job. Of course, we assisted him; the propeller assembly being extremely difficult even for us with thumbs.

At last, the cat airplane was finished and the first thing we noticed is that the cockpit was rather a tight squeeze for a big fellah like Raoul.  He was quite determined and was barely able to squeeze himself in, but he eventually did.  Once in, he really looked fantastic! Purring like mad, he tried to find the controls, but there were none.  Thinking that he had mistakenly purchased a glider, he requested that we lift the plane (with him still inside) up to his usual bookcase perch and then give him a shove. Needless to say, we refused!

It took lots of explaining on our part to convince Raoul that he had not purchased a real plane but merely a toy. He is quite disillusioned now. He mostly sleeps or sits and stares off into the far distance, a cat with shattered dreams.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"So, I wanted to remove an item from my tank. First, I should say, I have a 25G aquarium with a Cascade 700 filter. Which is a canister filter for aquariums up to 65G. Obviously I'm over filtering and it creates a strong current, which I like because I primarily do a planted tank.

Pros;
1) It kept my tank at a very stable 82 degrees. I kept it high on purpose as I breed German Blue Rams. It was fabulous, and I temp gauge always seemed to be working. It turned on/off appropriately.
I really like this stability because it can be harder to get it with glass/titanium heaters that are inside the aquarium.

2) Another item out of the tank! Seriously, it was so nice not having a heater in the tank.

Cons;
1) The main reason I'm sending this back is that it extremely and negatively impacted the water flow rate. In the instructions it says to put it on the outfilter tube -- and I did, but because this device has to be VERTICAL to avoid air bubbles getting trapped, rising to surface, and damaging it-- I had to have a lot of extra tubing. This significant drop in outflow made it impossible for it to properly aerate my water, and it also allowed for algae spores to settle.

Now, a solution to this would be ideally to put it into the infilter tube instead.  However, because I have a planted tank I ultimately decided against this. I didn't want to to deal with lots of gunk getting in the heater pipe. =/ I mean, that's the idea essentially to putting it on infilter over outfilter. It would be easy enough to clean out, but I looked at it as another frustration.

So, because of the cons, I ended up returning it. I mean, even with a circulation pump in my aquarium, I hated that the filter had been impacted so dramatically.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"**UPDATED AT THE END**

When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good products that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!

GENERAL
First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!

EFFECTIVENESS
We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!

WHY 5 STARS??
- Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product
- Smells GREAT!
- Contains no harmful chemicals!

OVERALL
Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!

**UPDATE 03/2012**
We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!",0

I had to get a larger version, as the diapers are too big for her.

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I have to put the disclaimer out there that we are not done training!! This is why I've only given 4 stars. I had to pause in the training as we went away (kitty went with) and didn't want to thoroughly confuse the poor guy!

I have a young Maine Coon. He's approx. 17lbs. The CitiKitty has no trouble holding his weight. I considered toilet training after meeting a woman who has four cats and 1 bathroom. She and her husband trained their four cats to all use the toilet. It made me chuckle when she told us about it, but it stayed in the back of my mind.

I got tired of stepping in litter - the Big Naughty is a slob! - and remembered the toilet training scenario mentioned above and decided to look into it.

Week 1:
The first week this worked really well. The Big Naughty didn't have any accidents.

Week 2:
After removing the inner ring, Naughty wasn't as big a fan of going on the toilet. He had a few accidents, and once he started going on the toilet again he decided he didn't like (or couldn't figure out) to go poo in the toilet; so he would go on the floor beside the toilet. As suggested we kept the ring at the week 2 mark for an extra week, but then I went away for the holidays and took him with me so I decided to put the training on hold until after we returned so as not to confuse him.

I've yet to commence training again, I have quite a busy schedule. I am looking forward to starting again and completing the training. I dream of the day I do not step in the scattered litter on the bathroom floor, no longer having to sweep litter up daily, no longer buying litter, no more scooping litter, etc.

I will update more thoroughly once we make the concerted effort to train again.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have had dogs for over 30 years and have used a wide variety of crates. I currently own the larger MidWest iCrate, a larger 'generic brand' crate, this size in 'generic brand', and an extra large all steel crate, along with many airline style travel crates.

When I recently acquired a new 4 pound puppy, the MidWest iCrate was my first choice in new crates to buy for him.  The 24 inch size is ideal for this size puppy and the 12 pound dog he will grow into.  The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",0

Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"The prduct description for these toys says they are ""ecologically responsible"".  I personally don't think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action.  If you love your pets enough to buy them lots of nice toys, then you're an animal lover like myself.  If you love animals as much as I do, then you're probably a vegetarian and don't use animal products like leather.  When I purchased these cat toys I was not aware that they were made with leather because the product description omits this detail.  As soon as I opened the box from Amazon and saw the genuine leather fish heads I was absolutely furious!  Why on earth would I want one animal to suffer - a cow used for its hide - so that I can provide a play toy for another animal - my cat?  I would never kill a cat to use its hide to make a toy for a cow!!

I did end up keeping the toys because I didn't want to deal with returning them - which would also be ecologically irresponsible with the resources going in to the shipping process.  Also, one of my cats absolutely loves feather toys which was the main reason I purchased these in the first place, so I gave him the fishies and he loves them.  They aren't the most popular toys in the kitty basket, but they haven't gone unused.  If my cats are really hyper and I toss the fishies in the air for them they will go after them, but if the toys are just laying there the cats don't go up to them and start playing with them.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.

A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.

Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.

I have a two year old Lab that had this bed on the floor and had to take it away. She loves to sleep on it. It is a nice size for a small dog. My dog loves this toy. I put him through his paces in the sandbox and have been very happy with it.,1
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"These made my dog sick. The other night she was vomiting all night long and had terrible diarrhea. The poor girl was so nauseated that she was dry heaving after completely emptying her stomach. It went on and on for hours. She basically was suffering the same symptoms that humans do when they have a very bad case of food poisoning, complete with chills and shivering, very sore abdominal muscles, weakness and dehydration. It was just awful for her. In the morning, of course, we rushed her to the vet. That was Saturday morning and now it's the wee hours of Monday (I can't sleep) and she's still at the animal hospital having IV fluids, anti-emetics and antibiotics. The vet hopes she can come home later today, but it might not be until tomorrow. The ONLY thing my dogs ate that was new and different in the last several days were these T-Bonz. They each got 2 as a treat. I didn't think the treats had anything to do with it until my other dog had diarrhea and threw-up a bit that morning before we went to the vet. Thankfully he only vomited once and only had a bit of diarrhea and soft stools a couple of times. My pup that got sick had a splenectomy last year, so I'm thinking that whatever was in these treats that made them sick, her body just had a much harder time fighting it off than his. I strongly recommend you NOT give your dog these treats unless you're willing to risk a hefty vet bill, a very sick and completely miserable dog, along with a miserable family, themselves all sick with worry. (Also, just in case it helps anyone or helps add some perspective and clarity: my dog that got very sick is a 20lb schnauzer female, 10 years-old. The dog with a bit stronger stomach is a cocker spaniel-mix male that's 37lbs and he's roughly 10 years-old, give-or-take a couple of years.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"What can I say? I'm a 5'6"" 40-something eventer with big horses and having a mounting block sure makes setting and resetting fences much easier.  I used to have a three-step block and unfortunately, the friend to whom I loaned it managed to break it (yep, really!).  So, missing my block, I ordered this one.  At first, I missed having that top third step, but after a week or so, I got used to it.
What I like:  Stability.  I have a youngster who is learning to stand still for mounting, and this block has a nice, wide base, so it doesn't move around easily.  I can get on and off 20 times, holding a fidgety youngster, and this block never threatens to tip over.  The steps themselves are plenty wide enough to allow for standing (not just stepping) on them.  The handle is built into the front instead of the back, which makes the block easier to pick up.  While substantial enough in weight, it's light enough to pick up and carry across the arena in one hand (while leading a horse with the other hand) without any real effort.

What I don't like:  I wish it were about 2"" taller.  Also, the recessed area on the back side (not visible in the product photos on Amazon) will make a very attractive nesting location for yellowjackets - a better design would be a straight side all the way down the back.  And finally, the steps are either slightly warped or designed to have a slight depression in the middle of each step.  This means the mounting block collects water and must be tipped off before using after a rainstorm.  I suspect this is a design element to enhance step stability, but the problem of water collection could be eliminated by drilling a small hole in the middle of the depression (I may do this myself).",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"It is such a struggle, especially with the fact that you can't keep your dog in the crate.

I had to replace the bowls and then the plastic one. The plastic bowls were just as bad as the plastic ones I had before. I would not use it again.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Purchased this for my adopted puppy. He was 10 months old, and over 90lbs when we got him. He came from a neglectful home, had never walked on a leash and was not trained at all. He pulls a lot on the leash, and is a jumper. A regular collar and leash was not cutting it. The only attention he got at home before was when he jumped up on his owners, which he did to us, then got him over excited and he began to mouth and nip. At almost 100lbs, this normal puppy behavior did a lot of damage.
This product is well constructed, and good quality. It comes with an instructional DVD as well. However, I followed the DVD, and eased him into sizing and wearing this, gave him lots of love and treats during the whole process. He seemed fine with it and I tried having him wear it for a couple seconds at a time and went from there. He didn't seem to have a problem wearing it. However, when it came to actually using with a leash, my dog simply would not have it. He would struggle and/or flop to the floor and not move, and he always found a way out of the nose piece, even though it fit the way the video said it should. My dog is very stubborn and the most I could ever get him to walk on this was one lap around the living room. I wish this had worked for us, but it just wasn't a good fit for us. We bought the ""Easy Walk Dog Harness"" by the same brand at the same time, thinking we'd start with this one and work our way up to just the regular harness. It didn't work out that way, but the easy walk hardness was a much better fit. Don't give up too quickly if you have a difficult dog, or are an inexperienced dog owner like I am.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"As a recent new cat person, I purchased this for my cat to have a place to scratch, perch, and play. My cat was immediately interested in this condo, even as I was putting it together. Assembly wasn't too hard, I just followed what another reviewer had suggested and used a picture for reference. It should be noted that this unit is kind of HUGE. It is very tall! While the size works just fine for where I have it located, make sure to check the dimensions of your space before purchasing.

A few months after adopting my first cat, I adopted a second one. Both cats, each around 8 pounds, love to jump from the different perches. Though all the screws are tightened (something I check monthly as they tend to loosen over time), the whole thing does shake when they are running around on it. This does not seem to bother the cats, and therefore does not bother me. This unit has lived on hardwood floors and carpeting, neither flooring seems to aid or reduce in the amount of shaking. My cats do not spend much time in either cubby space, they mostly make use of the perches. While I love the blue color of this unit, it does highlight the amount of cat hair left behind. I vacuum the condo about once every 1-2 weeks.

I have had this unit for about 9 months and it has suffered a bit of damage. The highest perch is the most popular, and thus has suffered some minor shredding/tearing of the blue carpeting. The top hanging mouse has not survived, but the lower one is still hanging on. Finally, the base of the unit suffered some damage from my robot vacuum. I now block off the condo so that he cannot climb up it anymore (obviously not the cat trees fault).

Overall I think this is a great cat condo, and every time I see my cats playing on it, I feel happy.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"After reading many pet water fountain reviews, I bought this fountain as a solution to my cats constantly drinking out of the toilet.  I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowls twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.  They still use all the options but drink out of the fountain enough so that I have to add between a pint and a quart of water each day.

I have 2 long-haired cats and 2 short-haired, all under a year old.  The fountain has not clogged from all the hair!  It's great that it has a filter.  I clean it  every week or 2 by hand.  It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher.  I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa.  The cats have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it.

It was easy to set up.  Once I figured out that the hose from the pump needs to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there was nice water movement.

I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splashes out.  If anyone knows what mat works best with this, please add that to your review.

I have it in the living room and I think location is important.  There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is.  And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain.  It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door.

It's a very quiet fountain.  You can hear the pump slightly, but it's a relaxing sound.  I don't unplug it at night.  It runs 24/7.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Our two labs roam our acreage doing their rabbit/mouse/fieldrat routine every day, come rain or shine no matter what the season.  They often came home in the summer afternoon covered in several types of burrs, fescue seed, mud covered noses, dirty faces, and tongues hanging out the sides.

But of course, they've brought home several kinds of ticks who had free loaded back to the homestead.  Going over every inch of their ""happy to see you, dad, I had fun"" bodies was a nightly ritual.  I say WAS because we then discovered the Preventic tick collars.

These collars are the greatest invention since the riding lawn mower!  Now the only ticks we see are the live ones crawling on top of their fur looking for just the right place to bite.  If one does happen to attach, it will be dead within 24 hours.

These collars last 90 days before they need to be replaced.  We put them on the dogs at the first of May when the first ticks appear (although I think the little suckers can crawl at -10 degrees on top of inch thick ice!) and then again at the first of August.  This application keeps the grinning duo tick free and both their lives and our lives much happier.  But I feel they kinda miss the attention of daddy tick hunting their bodies every day.

The dogs have never had the slightest skin irritation due to the collars but we don't but them on extremely tight.  I can still get four fingers under them.  The other nice thing about the collars is that if for some reason they get their collars caught in a fence or a limb, they are easily stretched so the dogs can get themselves loose without choking .  We've had one collar lost only once in the four years we've used the collars and although expensive to lose a collar, well worth knowing the dog wasn't hurt.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I have the standard Litter Genie, and I think it's the greatest! I don't understand the negative reviews--in one, it almost sounds like the person was trying to empty their whole litter box into the Genie. Cleaning the litter box will never be a pleasant experience (until my cat starts pooping gold nuggets!), but Litter Genie makes the process neat and easy. I simply use the provided scoop, pick the box clean, and ""flush"" the collection down into the collection bag. No problems and no odor! I am very sensitive to litter box odor, and there has been none since I got my Litter Genie.
Replacing the bags is a breeze, too. Inside the compartment is a cutter--simply pull the bag down from the refill so there is enough to tie a knot in the top of the filled bag. Remove the filled bag. Then, make your new bag by simply tying a firm knot in the cut end of the plastic, forming the bottom of your new bag. Pull down enough material to fill the compartment, close the container, and you're done.

I have one, and occasionally two, cats inside and two litter boxes. Even with two cats, one bag will last me 2-3 weeks. I use natural corncob litter, which is easy to scoop. Very little unused litter gets into my Litter Genie. I don't find it necessary to use a hack for the replacement bags. The refills are reasonably priced since I don't have to change the bag every day (like some reviewers said they were doing). It's easy to carry the Litter Genie between litter boxes because there is a convenient carrying opening on the back, near the top. I have never had trouble with it coming apart while I was carrying it.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,I decided to purchase a newer canister type filter.  The reason for this is my 54 gallon tank had been shut down for 3 months with only the dried up gravel in it.  So I started it back up in October of 2014 with my Magnum 350.  I decided to test my tank for ph and ammonia levels and found out that the ammonia was 1.0 ppm too high.  Of course I immediately dosed the tank with Ammo Lock.  Other then that the tank was doing well with no fish in it as of yet.  Because of the ammonia I went to my local pet store supplier and purchase the Aqua top CF400UV.  Installed it and within 24 hours the tank started to cloud up.  I made several water changes and cleaned the filter several times over a period of 2 weeks to no avail.  I contacted my local supplier and they replaced it thinking it must have been defective.  Well! The tank never cleared even after another 10 days of water changes and filter changes.  So I thought I would reinstall my Magnum 350.  Within 12 hours my tank was nearly clear.  After 24 hours it was crystal clear.  So I guess I have to say that I either got two defective filters or the Aqua top 400 UV just could not handle my water condition.  I have over 30 years experience with fish and tanks and I am baffled by this.  I found the filter easy to use and to be very quiet.  Just as an FYI for others who are new to this non self priming filter.  You should fill the canister first about 1 from the top and install the cover then fill the in and out inlets.  Hook it up and just press the primmer button twice or more and just turn it on and you are good to go.,0

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"I just received my feeders. I bought the 2 pack on Amazon. I just set it up so I'll update my review later once I've had it a while.

But for now, here are my observations. I have 5 cats. I find it hard to leave them for extended periods because it's too much for someone to scoop the litter and feed them etc. I boarded them once last summer. But it's not cheap and they are so trqumatized. I wanted to be able to go away for least a couple days. So I researched automatic feeders. I read all the reviews and some are very good some had issues. For this price for two, I decided to give it a shot...

Sturdiness: I real the instructions and set it up. I attempted to lift it by the lid just to test the sturdiness a little and it held nicely. I'm sure rowdy animals can get around that ... oh well.

Programming: Just like a clock, read the directions. Press buttons. It was easy. To test it, I put 5 cups in the hopper. And choose to dispense 1 cup at feeding.

Portion dispensed: After it dispensed, I measured the amount. It actually dispensed about 3/4 cup instead of a full cup. But I've heard it sometimes releases 1/4 less the first time it rotates. So I'll see next time.

Sound: I was testing it so I stood right by it when it went off. Only sound I heard was the kibble dropping into the bowl. No loud grinding at all.

I am going to set the other one up and test them a few times and I'll update my review. So far so good...

Update: So I've had it a couple days now and it is dispensing what it says it will. Again, the only it makes is the food hitting the bowl. Cats were surprised the first time it did it while they were next to it. But now it doesn't bother them. So far, it's been a great purchase.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"Everlasting Fun Treat Ball / B0009YD8NS

I have several treat dispensing toys for my puppy, and I like this one the least. The design is very poor, in my opinion, at least compared to other treat toys we've used. To begin with, it is difficult to ""load"" the toy with food and treats because there are two identical loading holes, one opposite the other. This means that when I pour treats in, they pour right out on the opposite side. It's like filling a bucket with no bottom, and it's very frustrating. Eventually, you have to just find the biggest treats you can, and jam them in, which is a pain and a half. Not to mention the edges of the hole catch and grab at your fingers - fun!

That brings me to my next point - you cannot put small treats or puppy kibble in here as they will fall out immediately. Only big fat treats will provide the dog a challenge, but fortunately the makers of this product make such treats and are more than willing to sell them to you. Which is fine, I guess, and I went ahead and bought some, but I prefer to fill my treat toys with at least some regular kibble so that the puppy doesn't just gorge himself on a bunch of rich treats all at once. Since this ball won't allow me to do this, it's now an occasional toy, not a reliable daily toy. Bottom line: I feel that this toy is difficult to fill, and can only be used for ""treat gorging"" and not for regular dinner time. If your fingers are less delicate than mine and you just want a treat ball, you may like this - my dog certainly likes the chewy rubber and he hasn't destroyed it yet (although he's not much of a chewer). However, if you want an easy to fill ball that can hold kibble and enliven dinner time, I recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Paw-Tricky-Treat-Ball/dp/B0002DK26M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Paw Tricky Treat Ball</a>.",0

It's easy to put together and I can't be sure it will last.  I don't have to worry about it breaking down at all and it's a good size for our dogs.  It is well made and it works well.  The only downside is that it doesn't fit my dogs.  I haven't tried it yet, but I'll see if it works.  My dog is very picky and I have to be careful of her and that's what she likes to do.  She doesn't like to",1
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I'm a perfectionist, in all I do and in my work; I expect the same pride in workmanship and design as I put into my own designs and products...

This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.

There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.

My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.

Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.  My twenty year old bowls look brand new, even after 20 years of dishwasher abuse.  Whereas, my week old Indipets bowl is ALREADY scratched, falling apart and has pinched my finger so hard I still have a huge blood blister on my finger..",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"I picked up this product and it was the best. I will keep purchasing it. Very nice. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very sensitive ear. She had no issues with it, which was great. This was also great for her. I had a 2 year old German Shepherd and it was very sensitive and it was a struggle to get it to stay in place. I put a few drops on her ear and it worked very well. She was very happy with it. I would definitely recommend this product to any dog owner. I have a 15 pound Yorkie mix. She is a bit smaller than most dogs, but she is still a little bit on the small side, so I thought she would be fine. She's a bit bigger than most dogs, but she is still a little on the small side. I wish it had a small collar, but I don't think I will buy it. I would definitely recommend this product. I love this product. I use it for my dog when he's getting used to the scent of the grass, and it's very strong and lasts for a long time. It's very gentle on his skin, and it really helps him stay on his feet, he doesn't slip down and it's a great quality product. My dog loves this product. I love this product! I use it as a pet carrier and a walker. The dog is very secure and comfortable and the way the collar locks is very secure. It's easy to put on, very secure. I also use it for a day or so and it's so much easier to get the dog in and out.",1
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.

After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.

Simple Maintenance is key:

If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it.
If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)

My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.

It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.

Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars.",0

He is always a bit stubborn with it and it has held up well.  I think it has held up well to a few pull ups.

Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"My dogs are fairly rough on toys - very few last for more than a week, and many die within a day or two. Obviously I am not alone in this: anyone reading this review is likely looking for a solid, durable toy which will survive the rough play of a chewer or large breed dog (or both).

This ball is not solid, and it is not durable.

The ball looks exactly like the 4.5"" model of a ""Soft & Tough Clutch"" ball I purchased last year. The cyan colored 6"" Soft & Tough Clutch that I purchased is easily my dogs' favorite toy, and has survived for many months now (I think I bought it in November) with nary a scratch. I decided to purchase a second ball because they loved it so much, and I went for the 4.5"" grape ball the next time around.

I took it out of the package and I could immediately feel the difference in the texture. I can't quite explain it, but the Soft & Tough feels exactly how its name describes it. This ball felt soft and rubbery, like the cheap $3-$5 Walmart toys I used to buy before I realized that they only lasted 10 minutes. The difference: this ball didn't even make it 10 minutes.

In less than 3 minutes, my dogs had begun taking chunks off of the ball and it had to go to the trash can. Put another way: prorated out, I was paying about $180/hour for this dog toy!!!

Bottom line: I am not sure if I got an imitation/knock-off, or if the balls are made by different companies. They look the same and are advertised the same on Amazon, but there was a clear and discernible difference in texture between the two balls, and that translated into the difference between a long-time favorite toy, and a 3-minute pile of garbage.

So buyer beware: the ""Soft & Clutch"" line earns 5 stars and then some, while the Soft-Flex ball is solidly in the ""don't waste your money on this"" category.",0

Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"I actually ordered the Litter Genie by mistake and let it sit for months. Now that I am using it I find the whole process annoying. This review should focus on the refills. It would be so much better if they came pre-sized with strongly sealed bottoms, perforated to separate and start a new one so all we have to do is push the refill down into the chamber. The whole size guessing, having to try to balloon out the plastic in the bottom to guess what length to cut then tie a secure knot in the bottom and hope you have performed all steps well enough so no blow-outs upon removal is vexing. The built in cutter works smoothly so scissors aren't needed. I am refraining from commenting on the entire device but can't separate  the two that easily. It might be better if the refills were better designed. I have a large cat with large urine clumps. They don't fit in the scoop and are ~too large to dump in the top. I use hard clumping scoopable litter. I wonder how messy it must be with old-fashioned clay, pine pellets or other media? I get tired of used litter scattering about during transfer, on the floor, the handles, the lip of the entrance and such.
I plan to use up the refills and donate this thing because my old large efficient sturdy scoop+ brown paper lunch bags collected into repurposed bags works better and is cheaper.
How about odor? I haven't quizzed friends but should. I am concerned because my cat has stopped defecating in his box since this was added and it is the ONLY change. Is it odor or something else that is distressing him? 40+ yrs as a cat owner and veterinary professional has me looking at all issues. Please no comments in cat litter box behavior...I've spent my life helping others. I just wonder if he hates this whole contraption as much as I do?

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"When my Yorkie was about to leave, she jumped in front of me and just brushed her teeth. I had to get a tooth comb out to get the toothpaste out, but it worked well and she didn't mind it at all. I bought this for my dog who is a chewer. He will go to the vet and the dog will start to notice the difference. It does not smell like dog food and he will be able to feel better. It's very easy to put on and it seems to really help with his teeth. I have a vet who makes a lot of money and does a great job on dog teeth. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to purchase it. I would recommend this product for anyone with a dog with a sensitive tooth. I have used this for about a year and it still works. My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. I took it to the vet and he told me that he had found a new toy that was very different and I was worried that it was not a toy he would be able to play with.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"LOVE THIS COVER!! The quality is excellent and I love that it covers not only the back seat, but also the sides of the back seat, the floor, and the backs of the front seats. Before I got this cover, I had old blankets trying to protect my leather seats from 2 large labs!  And any other covers I purchased didn't fit well and ended up useless.  It has great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even less if you are in a rush and you skip some of the steps that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fittings that attach it around headrests (rear seats and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fittings that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the sides of the vehicle as well as between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it does not slide around too much. It fits well in my Lexus ES350.  This does the trick of protecting the leather from their nails.  I especially like the generous flap that connects to the front seats and then hangs down to the floor to keep their hair contained, instead of flying all over.  I ordered the grey even thought my interior is tan.  I couldn't tell if I would like the tan shown in the pictures and I also have grey in other areas of my car so it blends well.  It was very easy to install but haven't figured out how to get the back of it to stay in place better but I feel like there is a way with a little help from my husband.  The main function is to keep the seat protected from their nails since I have the perforated leather that can easily be torn. I would definitely recommend!

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Update:  I received the 600 Professional today.  First off,  this filter is very large.  It completely dwarfs both my Fluval 305 and
Marineland 350 Magnum.

I also notice that like my Fluval 305,  the Hydor is manufactured in Italy.  Something I find interesting,  given all of the aquarium
filters that are made in China.

The 600 PRO is well  constructed,  with five media baskets:  two for mechanical filtration and three for biological filtration.

The motor housing for this filter is solid and well designed, and the motor itself  is completely silent.

The motor head is secured to the 600 PRO's canister  with front and back clamps, as well as side levers which offer
a tighter seal.

Even the media trays have nice adjustable plastic straps which allow for easy removal of media, and the trays themselves fit snugly into the 600 PRO's chassis, stacked atop one another.

Aesthetically,  the entire  Hydor Professional series has a refreshingly industrial look,  which exudes quality.

The fact that this filter was discounted by about $80 from its list price only makes the aforesaid that much better.

If the Hydor 600 PRO stands up as well as my Fluval 305 and  Eheim Classic filters have, I will consider this to be money well spent.

Highly recommended!

I have been considering purchasing one of these filters since they came out.  However, they were selling at list price for quite awhile.
So I decided to wait  until the prices became more reasonable.  I just found a brand new 600 for sale on Amazon for about $150, so I decided to purchase it.  Will update my experiences.  Based on what I have read about these filters thus far, I've left four stars.

This is the largest canister filter I have ever purchased.  I also own a Marineland Magnum 350 and a pair of Fluval 305s (350 GPH VS 260 GPH respectively), so at 345 GPH this will be about as large as the Magnum 350, even though the 600 dwarfs the 350 in size.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,3,CG,"Bought this especially to support my puppy and she loves it.  She also loves the smell and the fact that it is a plastic bag.  The dog is tall so it is easy to put on and it is easy to clean.  I wish it was stronger so it would have been more durable.  I also like the fact that the plastic is not cheap and so you can use it to put on a leash or a harness for your dog.  It is very easy to wash and holds up well.  The only thing I wish I could give it a 4 is that it is a bit heavier than I expected.  It is not too heavy for my dog.  I had hoped for a lighter weight, but I don't think I got the right size for her.  It has a little bit of a pull-off with the top part of the bag, but she is very well-behaved.  I will say that it does not upset her as much as the small bag that she had.  She is a big chewer so it is not too heavy for her.  It is not heavy, it is just very soft and she is able to run without it being a struggle.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  I will be ordering more soon.

Update:  It is now December of 2016 and my dog is still growing, but she is a bigger chewer, so she is not a great chewer, but she is still growing.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"We adopted Beast, a 60 lb mutt in early October. He seemed to be great, until he started eating my boyfriends things when we were gone at work. My boyfriend decided to buy a camera so we can see what he's doing when we're gone. Lo and behold the poor guy is so anxious he is howling the whole time we are gone! We had no idea! It wouldn't really bother us, but we live in a small apartment and if too many people complain, we will be forced to get rid of him. We started to try everything, classical music, leaving the tv on, closing the windows, opening the windows, crating him, giving him a frozen bone or kong to distract him, yelling at him over the camera, taking him for a nice long walk before we go, EVERYTHING. nothing worked. We were at our wits end, we had just adopted him and now were at risk for losing him!! This collar was on sale for $20. We bought it. Finally, we left and watched him on the camera. He started to howl and the collar beeped 3 times, and when he didn't stop, it finally zapped him. Yes, it was heartbreaking to hear him yelp, BUT he stopped!! (and it would have been more heartbreaking to give him away). Finally!! He only wears it when we are gone and it's super important to put it on the right way, or else it won't work.
First you have to make sure it's right under his head, not low on the neck where a regular collar would sit, but literally right underneath his head.
Then you have to make sure it's tight to the point where the actual box won't move if the dog scratches/shakes. You should still be able to fit one finger in, but it should be TIGHT.
Then you have to give a good shake before you go, so it's touching the dog's skin, NOT HIS FUR!

Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"Very happy with this Bellrock Growers Pet Greens, initially... I followed the instructions except I used a planter and did 2 containers instead of the bag and I added some organic potting soil of my own, underneath the provided soil and seeds.

After a few days in the shade, they were sprouting. After 5 days, it was growing to a nice length but a bit sparse. After 7 days, it was full and plentiful. I trimmed it daily, it was growing so fast. A month later, I started seeing some browning and then a bit of mold in the dirt. I don't think I've over-watered as I've been careful hoping to prevent that.

One of our two kittens eats his grass daily, like a little lawn mower every morning, smile. The other occasionally bites some off and plays with it. I put some clippings in their nightly dinner. No issues with vomiting and they both eat it just fine.

At about a dollar an ounce, I considered it a good value. I'm not sure if I'd buy a bag every month though. After some research, I'm going to dump what I have, wash the containers and give it another go. Next round, I'm going to try a spray bottle for watering instead, to provide a lighter watering and hopefully prevent mold.

I read that overwatering cat grass turns the soil acidic and encourages root rot. Contagions and harmful fungi that prefer overly moist soil can infect the grass and make the grass toxic for pets.

Definitely worth keeping an eye on. I don't fault the product though as mold growth has everything to do with moisture. The grass was lush, green, healthy, and the roots are strong and deep. 4 stars because it only lasted us a month but we will give it another shot.

USDA Organic. Uploading some photos so you can get a closer look. The photo collage was after 5 days of growth, when the kittens first tried it. The last photo was on the 7th day, when the grass had become more full in growth. Smile. Recommended.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,4,CG,"In terms of Belly Bands, this is the only one I've tried that my dog doesn't destroy. I had to replace the bowls with some other plastic ones because of the large amount of water in the bowl. I think it's because I don't want to have the water all over the floor. I think it's because the water on the bowl is really shallow. I just put a little bit of water in the bowl and it's a good size for my dog. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and he was skeptical at first. He loved it and put it on top of the other litter box.

Pet_Supplies_5,3,OR,"I am a full time dog trainer and I ordered this pouch in June. I wore this for 40 hours a week so I have to give some credit there, it held up pretty well for the amount of use. However, almost immediately the metal ring that stopped the cinch came out of the side of the bag and started to fray the material. I also did not have very good luck with the two sewn on straps next to the metal clip. They came out within the first month of me wearing the pouch. I had to use the cinch fairly often because dogs would find the pouch and stick their snoot in while I was talking to the owners, so I would cinch it closed. I finally ordered a new pouch in November (Doggone Good), so it took 6 months before I couldn't wear it any longer.

However, I did enjoy several features of the pouch which it seems my new pouch does not have. I could fit my iPhone 6 in the front zipper pocket easily so I could pull it out when I needed to make appointments or phone calls. As a woman, my pockets are very small so I am not sure where I am going to put my phone now. I also love the waste bag dispenser. I wholesaled ordered a bunch of waste bags so I was able to keep 3-5 rolls on me at a time, I never ran out. My new pouch only has room for two rolls. The metal clip on the back, even though I did not have the sewn straps, was very convenient and I could clip and unclip it from my belt very easily. I also liked that I could slip little things into the front mesh pocket, like prong collar links. So the bag isn't awful for the average dog owner, but won't withstand professional use.

I have included some pics so you can see how it looked the day I replaced it. The cinch area was in pretty rough shape at this point.",0

I would have liked it if it had a thicker plastic bowl. I would have liked to have gotten it in the plastic one instead. It has a very thin plastic base, so I wish I had bought it in the plastic one. I will have to check the size on the next time. I will update this review as I see it. I am really glad I bought this product. I would not have bought it in the plastic one. I have been using this to keep my dogs ears clean for several years and I have found it to be effective. It is very absorbent and absorbs more than my other shampoo products. I have not had any issues with skin irritation as a result. My cats love this food. They are about 20 lbs. They have been eating it for several years. The cats have never had any issues with the food, and I believe that it is a healthy food for them. I also have the odd cat that we mix with it, which is quite a challenge for us. The food is good quality and the cats love it. I will be ordering more of the other brands. Great quality. My dogs love it. I bought this for a friend who has a dog with a sensitive stomach. It's very easy to clean. It's not the best and there are some ways to get it out. I haven't used it yet but it seems to be working well.",1
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"The usual problem with reviewing cat toys is what to say when kitty doesn't like / use the toy. It's hard to evaluate a product made for cats as a human, so normally if I get a toy and Ms Cat does not like it, I say no harm, no foul and usually opine that someone else's cat may like the toy / furniture.

Not the case here. The entire premise of this toy is flawed, and I really don't think many cat owners or their pets will have much use for it.

First, the cat shown in the picture lounging on the arch of the X must have been a) very much smaller than normal cats and b) carefully trained. My own quadruped is very average sized and she could not at all lounge on this thing without drooping more than a third of her body off of it. Most cats will not willingly assume such a position, so don't think of this as furniture.

As a scratching post (and also as a theoretical lounging platform) this is also flawed, as it is very light weight and cheaply made. Cats will not use scratching posts that move around as they try to dig in, and this design is too light weight to offer the stability that a cat seeking to scratch is looking for.

My cat tried this once as a scratching post, after I poured catnip over it, and after it slid across the floor as she tried to stretch out, she turned her nose up at it and has not returned to it since.

Folks, if you want a scratching post, make sure it is solid and heavy. It will cost more than this does. If you want cat furniture, make sure it is solid and large enough to accommodate your cat. The designers of this product ignored these axioms and used a trained miniature cat to make it look more useful than it is.

Two stars, because your cat might like it as a scratching post if you can wedge it somewhere where it can't move around too easily.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,2,CG,"I have the Catit Jumbo (Cats are very picky about treats) and the Clipper. These two have the best combined power.  The clippers are the perfect size for a cat.  The smaller ones are a bit on the small side and don't seem to have the strength to hold up with the weight of the larger ones.  They are a little heavier than I expected.  I would not buy them again.  The Catit Jumbo is a better value for the price.My dog is a chewer.  He loves it, but I have a problem with it being too long for him to chew it up.  I bought another size for a different dog and he's a 5 pounder.  This size fits him perfect and I like it.  I wish it had been a little longer for him but he doesn't like it.  It was too big for him to chew on it and it was too big for him to chew on the handle.  I would have given it 5 stars but it didn't fit him well.  I will have to keep him from chewing on it because he is very picky and doesn't like having it on all the time.I have a Border Collie who is a mix.  He has a small back leg,  but this is a great harness for him.  I was looking for a harness for my dog with a different length.  I got this harness and it fits him perfectly.  He's a very picky dog, but this one is perfect.  I love the fact that he can't get a leg up on it or even a foot off it.  He loves it, but it's a",1
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"I was searching for a backpack to take my dog with me on bike rides. This one was more expensive than the other options, but it is well worth it. The sports sack is so well made - substantial canvas fabric, mesh air vents for those hot days, and two pockets for stashing keys and leash and things. Plus my boy loves it!  At first he wasn't thrilled about being stuffed into it, but now he gets all excited when I put it down on the floor because he loves coming along in my rides. He is always very content and fascinated by the scenery.

To put him in it, I place the unzipped sack on the floor and insert one paw into the appropriate leg opening. Then I grab his other leg and start to lift, which causes him to put weight on the first leg so I can pull the sack up on that side. Then I insert his second leg and clip the bag behind his neck. Next I lift and place his back legs, one at a time, into the sack, and after that I gently press on his rump to get him to sit down inside it. Finally I zip him up and lift him up to settle him down into the bag. Putting it in myself is the trickiest part, but I've gotten the hang of it after using it so much. I find it actually pretty comfortable to wear. It helps to cinch the straps and being the bag high up on my back.

For the fit, my boy is a 15 pound miniature poodle, long and lanky for his weight. I measured him according to the manufacturer's instructions, and his length was 17 inches, exactly on the borderline between small and medium. So I got a medium, and while it is roomy it doesn't seem too large. I haven't gotten the booster pad.

In summary, I recommend this sack highly!  It works so well for us and I am so grateful to this company for making such a high quality product.",0
Pet_Supplies_5,5,CG,"3/22/16 Update:  This has been an amazing purchase!  I will keep purchasing it!Very nice.I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and it was great.  We had a small dog and it was a perfect size for him.  He has large ears and the straps are very tight so it's easy to get the dog's ears open without damaging them.  I just put the straps on him and it is easy to put on and off.  The material is very soft and comfy, so I will buy again.This is a great product.  My dog has a lot of hair that doesn't fall out of her.  It is a very good product for keeping hair in a place.I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly.  He's a little hard to pull off the leash but he doesn't mind it.  It was very well made and was easy to put on.  I would recommend this for anyone who has a small dog.This stuff is great.  I use it to clean up the litter box when I have to vacuum it.  It's easy to use, doesn't get dirty or get stuck in the ground.  I don't smell it when I vacuum it but it smells great when I clean it.  I use it every other day.  I think I'll order it again.It's a great toy for our dog, but she's not a great chewer. She has a hard time getting her teeth cleaned but this one is a good size.I've tried many different brands and this is one of the best I've found for my dog.  She likes it so much, she likes it",1
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"We just got our first puppy about a month ago and did not realize how hard potty training would be. We live in an apartment and our puppy could not ""hold"" during his hourly trips to the elevator and outside, so we had to resort to an indoor potty. We first tried the scented pads- our pup would just play and shred them to pieces. We had a fake grass which worked well but it smelled really bad, clean up was a hassle and he was eating plastic bits. So when we came across DoggieLawn on Amazon, we decided to give it a try- at least he'll be eating real grass. It came on schedule in a prepackaged box, all you have to do is take off the lid, the grass was so green! Our puppy did his business on the grass immediately, but for the first few days there was a lot of grass eating and lounging on the pad.  You would need to supervise and make sure the dog is using it correctly. The best part is, there was no odor and no clean up! The urine gets absorbed in the grass pad and doesn't leak through the paper box. (we don't let him do #2 on the doggielawn). Also it's low maintenance- just spray with water a few times a week. We've had our doggielawn grass for a month now and it's time to change- it's turned brown and the odor is accumulating but it lasted longer than the 2 week period recommended by the company. Our pup has learned to go potty (#1) every time we put him on the grass. The downside is he was able to dig a small hole in the grass, however there's an option of getting an anti-dig mat which he haven't tried. Also, it is a bit expensive: $29 per one grass pad or a $50/month subscription for 2 pads. We'll keep getting these until he's fully potty trained!

We have a 10lb puppy and the standard size is perfect- there's enough room for him to circle and sniff.",0
