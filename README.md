### Project Description
This project is a sentiment analysis tool designed to detect fake reviews in datasets like Yelp reviews. 
It processes textual data, trains a deep learning model using LSTM and attention mechanisms, and serves the model through a Flask web application. 
The web app allows users to input reviews and receive a prediction of whether the review is fake or genuine.

### The Problem statement
Fake reviews are a significant problem in online platforms, leading to misleading information for consumers. 
Detecting such reviews manually is impractical, so we aim to solve this problem by automating the identification of fake reviews using machine learning and NLP.

### The Solution
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques like Word2Vec embeddings, 
LSTM networks with attention mechanisms, and a Flask API, we offer an automated solution for detecting fake reviews. 
This system will preprocess input reviews, classify them, and return the likelihood of a review being fake, all through a simple web interface.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Languages used: Python
-Frameworks used: Flask, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Gensim, NLTK
-Libraries used: Pandas, NumPy
