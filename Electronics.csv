This is a really well made Bluetooth device. It comes packed nicely. It comes with spare ear holder things and earbuds pieces. It has amazing battery life on standby and on call time as well. It is smaller than I expected but fits comfortably.
I like that it has a double sided tape on the dock that allows to stick it on the wall. It also comes with another piece to clip onto the vent of your car. It looks really nice.

I find it to be a wonderful camera for what I needed:  A camera that had fast, crisp autofocus and could take shots at a speed faster than every 3 or 4 seconds (which seems to be the typical recovery/ready time for most point and shoots in my experience).  Plus, I am rediscovering the joy of artistic photography with this camera.  I'll let the professionals argue over the value and performance for them, but for me, this is a winner!",0

Plus, the wires stay smooth and separated. Sadly, the earbuds don't isolate noise so well, as I often ride bike / go jogging with these, you can hear the wires rubbing and the wind interference, causing you to boost the volume in such situations.

Not gonna return it because I don't really need the CF slot.

They fit nicely in the ear but do take the time to see which of the sises fit best of the 3 fittings they send you.
The sound is VERY heavy in bass and is great to listen to techno and house genres. They lack in treble and have good enough mids. Not the best for listening to jazz or blues as the lack of treble does make things a little muddy, but not TOO bad. The cord is long enough and does not feel like it will snap easily.

fit-comfortable, and comes with different sized extra inserts.
you definitely hear the tunes, very clearly, but bass is not there.

PART II
after using them for awhile, i've upgraded my opinion of them to ""great"".
very comfortable as compared to apples things, which are very uncomfortable and sound pathetic.
sound is really CLEAR and crisp, i like that alot.  there is bass, but not like a good pair of headphones, its not blasting at you like a rappers car stereo in the hood. but its there if you have a good ear.

bought another pair as backup, new puppy likes them too :)

Magnetic snaps to keep it shut, access to the dock port, headphone jack, antenna, and I think volume controls on the 2G (not really sure,) a pocket to keep a small microfiber cloth in, and did I mention beautiful genuine leather?  My only complaint (which isn't really a complaint,) is that the belt clip isn't detachable, but come on...$10 FOR A LEATHER IPOD CASE!!!  I would definitely recommend to others.  Great value, great price, and I will never regret this purchase.",0

For those that want to run Linux headless with grub.  By default, grub runs in a terminal and without anything plugged in it will pick a resolution that is lower than the video card can display which will stop it from booting.  If you configure grub to run in the console rather than a terminal, it will fix it.  Hopefully that will save someone from spending the hours I did to figure that out.",0

For anyone else looking to do the dual-boot trick, the key is to use the most recent version of Ubuntu (the older versions don't play well with the Windows UEFI boot loader) and make sure you disable the Secure Boot option in your BIOS.  Also, turn off the Fast Startup in Windows 8 if you want to be able to access your Windows partition from Linux, otherwise Windows just hibernates instead of doing a complete shut down.",0

Further, when I power the speaker on, it doesn't automatically connect to the last known device.  I have to go back to my iMac every time and tell it to connect to the speaker.

This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I was looking for something to protect my Kindle DX in transit. I decided I would rather just take the Kindle out to read than get the kind of case designed to hold the Kindle while you read. I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

In sum, a fine product that does exactly what I want.",0
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've had 4 of these speakers hooked up to an Acoustic Research center channel and subwoofer as a complete 5.1 system.  These speakers have very nice and clear sounds.  In the past, I've had the Bose, Acoustic Research, and Klipsch Quintet III 5.1 systems, and these Energy Takes actually produce the best sound quality out of all of them.  For some reason, I'd like to replace speakers once every 3 years or so to sample their sounds, as some do it with cars.  It's hard to describe the sound quality as opposed to be heard to experience.  But to wrap it up, these Takes are the best speakers of all the bookshelf systems I've had.  Of course, none of them could come close to my top-of-the-line JBL tower speakers, but those are tower speakers and they cost $4000 (even 10 years ago).",0
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Just got it and it is a delight to use in drawing and Notes Applications which is why I bought it. It feels like a pen or pencil when writing and you can see where the tip is. That is a great advantage for detail work and for writing.

 I don't know if it would work as well for browsing and selecting things since it makes a small blunt sound as you touch the screen. It is annoying when pointing at things, but not there when sliding for writing and sketching. I bought spare points in case they are not available in the future. So far so good and I am loving it. Another great design is, that you can unwind the bottom part from the top and  screw it back on with the tip fitting inside the top part, where it is safe from any danger.",0

It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it for about an hour.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I highly recommend this case. Especially if you use your phone for things like watching video, reading documents and such.
The case is very protective at the corners which is where a phone gets most damage.
The two features i love are the standing slot and the auto on. Whenever you open the case the screen automatically turns on. This feature doesnt waste any battery and it saves you if your power button is losing. you don't even have to latch it everytime, I only latch it when i put it in my pocket. Normally i just let the cover down until the latch is resting on the edge and it shuts the screen off.
The inside is very soft and won't scratch the screen and the outside feels great.
Nothing i can find wrong with it except i wish it covered the edges of the phone more like it does the corners.",0
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done.",0
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I really like this alarm clock so far.  It works very well with the iPhone and I've only had a few small issues with it.  Occasionally when you put the iPhone in the cradle it will only start charging the phone, but it won't play the audio.  I've only had this happen maybe twice since I bought it 2 months ago.  I think it's something to do with if you're playing a song already when you plug the phone into the dock.

It looks great, and I really like how the dock slides back into the clock for when you're not using it.  The dimmer is nice, but I wish it would maybe go one shade darker.  The audio quality is superb considering the size.

Overall, I'm very happy with the money I spent on this unit compared to the other ones available on Amazon.",0

The only negative I can think of is the fact that it is a little bulky. I just wish it was a little longer, and it does not have a camera strap. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.

Sure, it doesn't have the same low end and clarity that a $300 speaker does, but this thing is great at this price point.  I was able to turn it on and connect my phone right out of the box.  I was playing music within 10 seconds of opening the box.  I was really impressed with the solid, sturdy feel and especially like the rubbery texture.  It feels much more expensive than it actually is.  It also has an auxiliary port which comes in handy if you happen to have an older mp3 player or something that doesn't have bluetooth support.  I don't expect I'll ever need to use it, but it is a nice addition.

It is a well made product.  Fits perfectly in your hand.  Allows you to set your DPI.  It can serve as a portable mouse, or as I use mine, a permanent mouse for my desktop.

What I wish someone told me before I wasted $9.95 on this:

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy.",0
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts.",0
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Since we started watching movies more frequently, I decided to upgrade my center speaker. After much research and thought, I purchased this amazing speaker. During this process, I listened and compared to a lot of center speakers; most of them expensive, and recognizable name brands. I am a singer and play several instruments, so I recognize good sound when I hear it. The sound of this speaker can be best described by the title of my review. The quality of the sound cannot be distorted even at extremely high volumes. If, after you buy this speaker, you do not have GREAT sound, it means that you do not have a good enough audio receiver. This speaker definitely maximized the best that my receiver puts out. Like I expected, this addition to my surround system truly added another level to our movie watching experience.

For normal use they cancel out surrounding sound, don't sound 'tinny' like other cheap earbuds. I actually only have two complaints.  The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.  Wrapping it around the provided 'cord manager' will cause this as well if left for long periods of time.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"Installed it on my Mitsubishi Outlander with Pioneer AVIC Z140BH head unit. Image quality is great at night or day. Doesn't cause the image to blow out when a car is driving behind you with their headlights on. Nice feature to allows ""tow view"" when using it with the Pioneer GPS Mode. Allows you to see your trailer etc while you drive.

CONS:
- Doesn't offer backup guide overlay like other cameras (dont know how useful it is, but would be nice to have the option)
- Doesn't offer multiple view angles like the Alpine units
- The curve of the lens seems to let water drops build up more when it gets wet which blocks and blurs the image. My camera is installed in the OEM hole that is drilled under the tailgate bar so its more protected and concealed, but I'm sure not all cars have this so the camera would be more exposed to the elements.",0
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This bag is working out perfectly for my wife in her new job. She never removes it from the wheels as it takes a couple minutes to convert over and isn't really hard to shoulder carry with the wheels.
Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this.",0
Electronics_5,4,OR,"This is the first camera case I have ever bought so I don't have anything to compare it to.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.

The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?

I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.

I purchased the exact item from Walmart for $59.99.
The sound is okay if you use an equalizer to balance things out. Small speakers *always* mean small sound.
The four corner speakers are 8 Watts each. Don't let the ""150W"" fool you. The center speaker's qualitty reminds me of a pocket radio's speaker. It's very mid-range only and there's almost no tonal quality to voices.
The cables should be longer. I'm going to have to make extensions for my application. That's not hard since the speakers, except for the front right, are RCA. I believe a 9-pin D-SUB extension cable will work for the front right speaker but I'm not sure yet.

There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

We have a HDTV, surround sound with receiver, two video game systems, a DVD player, a Roku, wires going to the speakers and a cable box. Our television is mounted up on the stand's mounts so the wires are dangling and also bunched up on the floor behind the stand. By using this, I was able to group all the wires and cords together then run them up in a single Promaster sleeve so it looks like a pipe coming up from the ground instead of a bunch of dangling wires. The floor has no clutter at all now. What I did was plan everything before starting it. I think it could become frustrating if not planned out.

This one has been great for all devices, solid signal strength about 30 feet beyond the perimeter of the house (brick). Setup is easy and the web interface for administrating the device (enter ""192.168.0.1"" in the address bar) is very intuitive and offers useful metrics as well as security options.

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue. But sometimes it is just the router (have tested directly from the modem) and both wireless and wired connections all fail.

It feels like the case will be strong enough to protect my laptop from superficial scratches and such, but I'm not sure that it would prevent more severe damage with major impact, grantedt I don't expect much more given the very affordable price of the product.

The keyboard cover is thinner than I imagined, but to be fair, I've never had a keyboard cover for my laptop so my only comparison was my imagination. It also has some creases in it from the way it was folded and packaged, so hopefully those will work themselves out with time and use.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price

-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit too small for a laptop. The keyboard is small, and it's not really a big deal for me. I'm sure it would be fine with a laptop.

The keyboard is also a bit big and hard to hold. I'd rather have my laptop on the lap or the couch than on my lap with a hard-drive.

Two side notes:

1) Make sure you look around for a water bottle that is closer to the length of the ""wick"". A normal .9fl oz (500ml) bottle is too tall for the wick to reach the bottom or at least closer to it so you have to fill the bottle up before it gets to  3/4 of the way empty.

2) If you don't use it everyday or even occasionally just from going home from work and coming back, the silver piece (metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency) at the top of the humidifier gets ""stuck"" and I have to kind of poke at it to get it running or shake the bottle up.

The WD was cheap and served well.  I've replaced many hundreds of drives in my career so I don't particularly get upset about the occasional failure and wouldn't characterize the product by a single experience.

When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade. I only wish that Pentax would have made the kit lens a bit better so it would be more useable.",0

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using.

This to me was amazing as the whistler liked to go off at every turn. The alarm sounds of the Escort are much less nerve racking and sounds loudly at first but will then cut the volume down. Another cool thing is the smart cord. This cord has a led only when it is plugged into the radar detector and has another led for when it is detecting radar. Again not in an annoying way. The escort has a dark mode which almost shuts all the led lights off so as not to distract you at night but the audibles will sounds and the smart cord led will light up but since it is down by the cigarette lighter and not in your face it does not distract you from the road.

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that makes everything you listen to on these sound muddy. Hi-Hats are hissy and piercing, and the strange emphasis on cymbal crashes and bass make all your music and lyrics sound painfully misperformed, like every instrument and lyric is acCENTed on the wrong sylLABle. Comply tips had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eyes detracts from the value of them.

I did like that these IEMS were small enough to comfortably fit in my tiny ears, unlike most bass-heavy IEMs out there. I liked the form factor and the sleek plug and cables as well, but these two things alone didn't make this pair a keeper for me. I ended up returning them.",0

Electronics_5,2,OR,"I bought this case from a store for my new iPad (3rd gen). While it does fit, it would slip out of the smaller clips on the left side of the case that hold the device every once in awhile. Finally, after having it for only 4 days, one of the clips snapped. So, needless to say I'm looking for a new case...

Here's what I liked about the case:
 - Very thin, and didn't add much bulkiness to the device
 - Nice thick cover with soft inside, made me feel that the screen would be protected.
 - The faux-leather cover dosen't look too ""fake""

What I didn't like:
 - The band that is made to hold the device closed. I stopped using it after the first day. Don't they know that this will just break off? Plus, the cover stays closed well on it's own.
 - The small clips that hold the iPad in the case on the left side. I couldn't understand why they couldn't use a longer band to hold the device in like the right side.",0

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I think it is similar in size to a full size computer mouse. I have no issues with video quality, with the exception of some bumpy Netflix experiences, but that's not a Roku issue.  I have convinced a few of my non-sports viewing friends to get rid of their cable completely and just use Roku.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus are my favorite channels, but I explore the other options every once in a while.

As a last resort I thought, why not disable the on board wireless and try a wireless card?

My laptop does not have a PCMCIA card slot, so I was limited to wireless express. This was the least expensive card I could find.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly narrow.  Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.  I cannot explain the acoustics that make this happen, but I am thoroughly surprised by and appreciative of it.  (The first music I listened to was a pre-hearing loss favorite  Van Morrisons Poetic Champions Compose.  The alto and soprano saxophones have reclaimed their divinity.)  The rated frequency response is 10  22K hertz.  The buds are comfortable and fit securely; I did not need to use the optional silicone tips.

By the way, I periodically clean the bud tips with a nearly dry, non-alcohol, fragrance-free baby/body wipe.  You might notice any human dirt with each use, but the grubbiness does build up over time.",0

I've never tried to play a guitar through it, but I'm sure it would be fine if you don't get carried away. When it's running on battery power, it does get significantly quieter, but still decently loud. While heavy, the carry strap does make it easy to carry around with you. All in all, I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The only thing I agree with, is the radio kinda sucks. No external antenna, so if the signal is weak it will be skipped over. There is also no fine tuning to the radio. If the station isn't strong, it will be skipped over. I rarely listen to radio, so it's not a big deal for me though.",0

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

I bought this in grey to protect the keys of my 2017 MBA. Not from liquid spills; this would only offer protection from light splashes, not a full spill. But from dust and crumbs.

The fit is really good, it lines up perfectly. It doesnt touch or damage the screen when the laptop is closed. Typing is harder, you have to press the keys harder and its a matte, somewhat tacky finish on the keyboard cover. This means traveling around the keyboard takes some getting used to. My only gripe is that the MacBook keyboard backlighting is seriously encumbered by this cover. The cover is not transparent where the characters on each key are labeled, meaning the light doesnt shine through. The only light you get is around each key. In a dim or dark area, its no good for seeing the keys.

I am a serious digital outdoor/travel photographer but tired of traveling with 28+ pounds of pro. level equipment.  I was looking for a ""go light"" quality built camera with lot of features and adjustments.  It came down to the Panasonic Lumix G-3 or Olympus Pen.  The Panasonic won the contest because it has both and high quality LCD screen AND a high quality viewfinder (although it is electronic not optical.)  In addition the LCD screen folder out and rotates270 degrees which is a very handy feature.  If you want a smaller 4/3 camera and are happy with just the LCD (no viewfinder) the Olympus may be a bit better camera.  The G-3 is much much lighter and smaller than my Canon 5D.  The only serious limitation is with the available reasonably priced lenses, the are relatively slow compared to more expensive 35mm camera lenses.  This is the reason for the 20mm lens, at F1.7 it is better for lowlight indoor or outdoor shooting.",0
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I installed the newest firmware, and DVDs still appear very pixellated. I can watch the same DVDs on my X-Box and they are MUCH clearer. I have both players connected by component cables, but I tried with basic RCA video on a non-HDTV and the pixellation was still horribly apparent. It does play a lot of formats, but I've found that Divx or Xvid usually looks better if I convert it to a DVD using dvdSanta and watch it on the X-box. For your video files not worth a whole dvd, or to fit over 30 hours of 256k quality MP3s on one DVD, it does the job. Maybe with firmware it will get better. Also, its goes real jittery and even the menus flicker spastically if in progressive scan mode. The web site suggests turning off progressive scan mode, yet this is still advertised and labeled as a progressive scan player. Play a lot of stuff for cheap, but it shows. Especially DVDs....

I didn't care  until I noticed that I was having some hand pain. Fearing it might be carpal tunnel, I ended up doing a bunch of hand stretches, and also replaced by keyboard with the amazon basics keyboard I was using before. I think the stretches helped fix damage that was done, and using the keyboard prevented any further damage from building up. My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues.

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.

One complaint: whoever designed the connector array never, ever tried to connect anything to it. The connectors, even if they were well placed, are hard to use; but they're crammed together such that my not-very-big fingers had a heck of a time connecting the speakers. Much bad language was used. In terms of function, I can set the unit to make much more boom-boom than I want or to be almost silent - or anything in between, including a setting I like.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"As others have said, they are a bit tinny, however, for my relatively simple needs, they're fine. I got them to replace an old pair of speakers for my desktop. They're even adequate for music for non-serious listeners, but the bass, as has been said, almost disappears. I also wanted something relatively small, due to limited desktop space, and these certainly are---the other speakers certainly weren't huge, but these really do give me some extra space. Lastly, as has also been said, the instructions talk about two cables, a green and a pink, which is usually for input with a microphone. However, there's only the green cable, which is fine. Plug it into the input jack, plug the normal size power cord into an outlet, and you're good to go. (The fact that it's a standard 2 prong plug, rather than a large brick like my old speakers, was a further bonus. )

I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can).

I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps.",0

-Easy installation, setup guide is well written and easy to follow
-8,000 square feet WiFi Coverage
-Easy to reach on/off switch, it is nice not to have to unplug a device just to cycle power
-Wireless Client Isolation, WiFi users can be protected from each other

 Cons

-Only has one LAN port, sure you can get a small gigabyte switch for cheap, but that is one more thing to plug in.
-Includes many advances features not needed by the average user which can be intimidating, you are paying for all these features so if you do not need them this might not be the right device for you.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.

The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that ""DR"" in an address means ""Drive"" and not ""Doctor"".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Frequent glitches such as freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS devices simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issues with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI as it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional.

The only wish I had with this product was to have a little more documentation.  The only help info is on the box and that doesn't cover much.  I was able to figure it out but it would be nice to have a bit more. I did get a disocunt on this product but that did not affect my view on it.  I really think this is a nice air mouse.,0
Electronics_5,5,OR,We have multiple iPads with different movies and TV shows on each.  With the iPad storage limitations I had to pick and choose periodically to remove and add movies.  With the Seagate Wireless everyone can watch whatever they want.  I copied almost our entire DVD collection as well as our iTune movies to the Seagate and now there's never a shortage of something to watch.  I have a 6 year old daughter and entertainment on the go is a must.  We also connect the iPad to our T&C van and watch movies stored on the Seagate on the car DVD screen.  The picture is not as crystal clear as when a DVD is playing but we're willing to sacrifice a little clarity.  We recently went on a short (maybe 1.5 hour trip) with 5 kids in the car ranging in age and this was a life saver.  The kids could hear and see the movie perfectly.  Have you ever tried to watch 5 kids try to listen and watch a movie on one iPad?  It's not a good thing.  The Seagate makes it possible to give choices on what movie to watch and I carry it with me everywhere now.,0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...].
One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it!
When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally.
Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched.
A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way.
I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year.
I'd encourage anyone to try this out,it's a good one.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I do like it. It works well. The complaints I have about it are relatively minor:
1) It does use quite a bit of space. To keep the arms from extending beyond the back of my desk (which was important in my particular setting), I had to mount it (drill the hole) almost 12"" in from the back edge of the desk. That places the monitors about 15"" in from the back edge of the desk.
2) Cord management is minimal. The upper of the arms, the cords are simply ""tied under"". The lower of the arms, the cords are held inside by the most complex piece of molded plastic known to man, which must be carefully inserted by a Plastics-Certified Brain Surgeon. I am surprised that they didn't think to allow the cord management to share a hole with the support itself, which would have been handy.
3) It says ""amazon basics"" on a prominent logo right in the middle of the base. I don't need more logos on my stuff, unless you're going to pay me handsomely to display them. (This will work to cover the logo: https://smile.amazon.com/Scotch-Duct-Black-1-88-Inch-60-Yard/dp/B0013AX6FC/)

This keyboard is flawless.  It paired up instantly with my iPhone, and boom.  I was typing on my iPhone in by just pairing the device in Settings.  Yes, that easy.  It is charged via a USB port, so good to have one of those USB-to-electric adapters(which are super cheap).  Or you can charge it on any USB port anywhere.  Not exactly sure how long the charge holds for, as I never let it get to that point.  This device is combined with my iPhone to be charged overnight which works for my purposes (again, I'm 56)

Electronics_5,2,OR,"This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

Electronics_5,3,OR,"This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.",0

I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.

Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"My MacBook Pro gets hot. I have to run it with a cooling fan or it will start slowing down. (In order to keep itself from overheating, Macs manage the temperature by adding more idle processes into the queue until it's cooled down!)

I was using a different laptop cooling fan solution before this, but it was noisy and barely helping unless it was on high (extra loud mode).

When I ordered this, I was expecting better cooling from a larger fan, but the other MAJOR benefit to a large fan, and the main reason I bought this item, is that it's almost silent. Smaller fans spin faster and therefore make more noise.

This fan is almost as big as the 15"" MacBook Pro. The stand itself, leaves about 1"" around each side. You can use it with or without the stand. When sitting flat, it has a very clean and simple profile.

Finally, I love the bamboo - it was a final selling point for me.

BTW, they sell a ""pro"" version of this, with a nifty adjustable stand. I would have bought that, but it has two small fans, so it would be noisier than this one. I use this sitting flat with the lid closed and plugged into one monitor, so adjusting the angle is a moot point.",0

A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers.

One thing to watch for is whether you are set for it to give the shortest route or the fastest route.  The shortest route will often take you on some pretty bizarre journeys, while fastest route will generally get you onto the major arteries and highways that you'll most likely want to use and remember.  Another thing it took me a while to realize is that you can change the default screen settings to tell you the direction of travel you are going in.  I find that more useful than displaying the time to my destination, which in my experience the device consistently underestimates.  Also not sure why they bothered to have the device tell you your speed, since cars already have speedometers.  Still, a very handy device that I now find almost indispensable.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.",0

I was immediately impressed with the appearance, it has some weight to it and is definitely bigger than I thought it would be. It comes with a few things to mount it whichever way works for you but I've only used the ring thingy on top to hang it on the shower hook and the suction cup a couple times. Now, the suction cup..I might be missing something but to me it doesn't seem to work very well at all and I don't feel comfortable leaving it suctioned on over water because it'll probably fall in and I don't want to test to see how waterproof it really is. It's really easy to connect it to your Bluetooth and it's way louder than I expected (SCORE!!!) The only other con I've found is that sometimes when I'm using it it'll randomly connect with my husband's Bluetooth and go silent. I'm actually not sure it's connecting with his Bluetooth or just interfering but either way it's annoying to have to keep reconnecting it.

Original Review
Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.

I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice. The cord gets in the way a bit if you wear your phone/mp3 on your arm but there is clip that helps keeps it out of the way.  The cord is a good length if you are keeping the phone/mp3 in your pocket.",0
Electronics_5,4,OR,"I bought this as a gift to someone, so I do listen to them occasionally. I myself is using Klipsch Image X10i to listen to music everyday. In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.
  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.
  Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two.",0
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Since I just recently purchased this lens, I noticed a few things.

First, the lens is so small that it's not easy to get around. This is a very large lens with a small lens hood.

Second, it's not very compact. If you have a large camera, it's a huge difference between a medium-sized lens and a compact one.

Third, the lens has a VERY weak grip on my hand. It's very hard to press it to the point where I accidentally drop it, and I'm forced to hold it just a little too tightly.

Fourth, the lens is a bit too big. It's a bit too large for my hand and I'm forced to hold it too close to my eye.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I own a 2005 Cadillac CTS with a Bose system. If I were Bose, I would be ashamed to put my name on it as the factory speakers suck so badly. I replaced the sub with a Kicker and amp and the front door speakers with a pair of Infinity reference 6032cf's I got from Amazon. I went with these as they are 2 ohm just as the system speakers are.

These speakers are incredible! With the sub dialed in to my base level preference the sound system now sounds like it should have with the name BOSE on it.

These speakers are not meant to be a replacement base speaker, however they do an admirable job with it. The two position (0db - 3db)tweeter is phenomenal and the mids are so clear! Since I'm not trying to explode my kidneys or rock the car next to me with too much volume, I am more than pleased with Infinity.

A word of caution here... the Infinity site says that the rear door speakers for the first generation CTS are 6.5""... Do NOT believe it. the rears are 5.25""... I had to return one set 6.5's and I'm waiting for the 5.25's to arrive so I can finish the install.

I picked up a pair of Sony bookshelf speakers at a thrift shop months ago and decided it was time to mount them.  But I wanted a mounting that was simple, cheap, and effective, took a chance on these satellite speaker mounts and found them to be perfect.

The mounts can fit both single screw speakers (like my Sony) and double screw speakers, they can also be set up to be longer (about 5"") or shorter (about 3"") and come with the screws and hardware to mount to the speaker and to the wall (including dry wall anchors)  The mounts also include the Allen wrench necessary to adjust the mounts and permit the speaker to be oriented just about in any direction or attitude.

With the help of my cordless screwdriver, I had both speakers mounted nicely on the wall in about 15 minutes.  (And that includes looking over the included instructions until I realized that one could actually ignore them.)  Now these aren't the most beautiful speaker mounts, and they are plastic so don't try and mount some huge 20-lb speaker.

I notified Amazon and they sent out a replacement drive right away. One thing about RAID5 arrays...making changes takes forever. It took a 2 days to initialize my array and 4 days to rebuild it after replacing the failed drive. A week later the RAID management software came up with an error indicating that the replacement drive could not be found. Turns out the SATA connector had come loose.

  What I didn't like was the lack of software capabilities.  For Ubuntu there are a couple application you can get like ""Me-Tv"" or ""Kaffine"", or for me ""Plex"".  For Windows users there is less freeware to choose from, instead after buying this card you would have to go to the Hauppauge webpage and spend an additional $10 for the WinTV software.  I feel this software really should come with the card.  Also note:  In some of the screenshots and details that advertise this card it says you can watch multiple shows at the same time (showing four windows).  The only ways to watch multiple shows is with their WinTv software, no other software will let you do this (not even Plex).

The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No.",0
Electronics_5,2,OR,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.  I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.",0

I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price.

Electronics_5,3,OR,"So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I like this because it is small and ergonomically well designed.  I am keeping it.  However, there are many tradeoffs and issues that anyone should note:

1.  The movie function is better in quality than stills for almost all conditions.

2.  The movie function sound picks up faint noise from absolutely everything the camera does, from zoom to auto adjust the focus.  This can only be heard under quiet conditions, but it is there, and in fact mentioned in the manual.

3.  The low light still is very poor, except if it is pitch dark and you set it for that condition.  I find taking pictures indoors without the flash superior than with it on.

4.  The camera is very sensitive to shakes during still...and the image stabalizer only works for movies.  This really needs a good image stabalizer for stills, since slight motion ruins the image, particularly in zoom.

5.  It is true you can take a still while recording a movie.  However, what is not mentioned, is that the movie is interrupted during the capture and that sounds of shutter clicking at quite high level invade the audio

A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste

-The removable camera compartment makes it a fully usable backpack.
-It comes with a bunch of Velcro inserts for the camera compartment so you can configure it how you want.

-The camera compartment is small.  It can hold my DSLR (Old T3i with 18-55 kit lens)) and barely a 55-250 lens. The camera wouldn't fit at all with the larger lens attached.
-If anything protrudes even slightly above the top of the camera compartment you can feel it in your back.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"I have had this keyboard for a year. I bought it because it is light and thin.  It succeeds in both those areas. The protruding hinge doesn't really bother me although it is not elegant.  The rest of the keboard actually is kind of cool.  I like the tilting mechanism when it is open. Some complain that the ipad falls out of the keyboard slot. It does occasionally but it works pretty well in general.  Now for the negative...and it has become big enough for me that I can't recommend the device.  The ipad and keyboard, when in the closed position, does not clasp shut.  The ipad rests in the closed position on top of the keyboard.  It easily slides off, but more often, it moves just enough to turn the ipad on and wear down the battery.  At least once or twice a week, I go to use it and it is dead because it just sat on for 12 hours. You can't see that it is turned on.  It is so frustrating. I don't know why they didn't make a clasp or connector to keep the thing closed.  Normal travel is bound to jar it open just enought to turn it on. Ugh.  If you can manage keeping it closed (or completely turn off the ipad each time) the keyboard works well.  Thats it.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more.",0
Electronics_5,5,CG,"Excellent wireless unit! Surprised at how fast the internet connection is!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the unit is a plastic ""good"" case, but it's a little difficult to open and close. I wish it had a little more padding for the corners. The only thing I wish I had known was that I could use this in a different room or on different floors. But that's not what I expected. I'm not sure if I would be able to use it in my room if I was sitting next to it. I think it would be more useful if I could just turn it on and off. I'm not sure if it would be better to just turn it on and off if I was sitting next to it. But I'll leave that for the next review.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

At set up, I tried using: first Wireless and later with cable 5e.  Just could not get them to work all together. I gave up and they are sitting unplugged in the corner for over 2 months.

Anyway, when you can get all 3 on supplied software on my PC, instructions want you to go into the Router security system's guts and change access for external viewing. We depend on the router for our living, working from home when away from office, and we dare not tamper with the internal setting of our router and risk loss of work and income.

Electronics_5,2,OR,I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.  Bottom line is relly unless you have a ton of time and a load of asprin I wouldn't suggest going for this card... I'll update if I manage to find some kind of solution but as it is it is far from plug and play.,0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop.

After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use.

It is an easy to operate, fairly sturdy device, but in my opinion is way over priced for what you get. And that isn't the main issue. The problems started after I had it for a few months. I would plug it into the my computer and it would not register as a connected device. It would charge and show the battery screen on the Walkman but the computer couldn't detect it. I had to plug it in and unplug is several times to get it to work. Then it stopped registering no matter what I did. I wondered if my computer driver was corrupted..even though it worked fine on other devices.  When I bought a new laptop and tried to connect it again...same problem.

It would instead either attempt to play a song or go to the charge screen without registering on the computer. I went into settings and used ""restore factory settings"". It made no difference.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"We bought this TV two weeks ago. Ordered from Onecall via Amazon. TV arrived very quickly, in fact so quickly we had to postpone delivery so that we could be home to receive. Onecall delivers via a regional carrier which dropped it off in our garage.

First impressions. TV screen is huge. The TV itself is fairly thin and weights just under 100 lbs. Although it might be obvious, don't buy this TV if you are going to be watching it from few feet away. Too close to the TV and regular cable will look fuzzy since the low resolution is magnified to a 58 inch screen. Amazing picture quality with Blu-ray without any optimization. Regular DVD and HD cable have an excellent picture as well. We are viewing it from about 12-14 feet which i think is optimal. No motion blur with action sequences.

There isn't too much glare appreciable even a sunny room in our house. The viewing angles are excellent which is one of the reasons we choose plasma over LCD.

The audio speakers are okay to good but you are better off with a surround sound system if you have it. The TV does have a faint buzzing sound that you can hear if you turn off the volume. It isn't annoying and I believe it goes away as the TV warms up.

Overall, a great TV for a reasonable price ($2099 is the lowest recently offered.) If you are looking for a large plasma, check it out.",0

1. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, or if you don't mind having to carry it around when not in use, it's plenty compact.
2. It's compact enough to fit in a backpack, or if you don't mind having to carry it around when not in use, it's plenty compact.
3. The sound quality is decent, and not overly loud, but I would prefer a little more bass, but I'm not sure that's a deal breaker.

The only real issue I have with it is the volume. It's a bit loud, but I would prefer to have it at 1/2 the volume.

Overall, it's a great projector, and the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not quite as bright as the HDTV that I have. It's not the brightest color, but that's not a big deal for me, but it's a big deal for me.

The only real issue I have with it is the remote. The remote is a bit too small for my liking, but it's not a big deal for me either",1

Lots of accessories. everything you need to get started vice a  SD card is in the box. including a short HDMI cable. Cons. 1. Terrible video quality. just terrible. grainy  and washed out. you will not be able to read a license plate of a car parked just in front and to the left or right of you. 2. Operation is not intuitive. crazyest sequence of button pushes I've ever experienced. the 'OK' button is not always 'Ok'. button pushing is on par with entering a cheat code in a video game console. I. e. UP, DOWN, MODE, UP, OK, MENU, MODE , UP, DOWN, UP, UP. argghh. 3. Freezes constantly. tape a paper clip to the side of it as your going to need to reset it constantly. 4.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it.
I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)
- RAW FILES -- have to use Adobe DNG converter to edit raw files.  Very annoying.",0

Electronics_5,3,OR,"Cons:
Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it.
I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable.
As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc.
5 second delay to get the mouse recognized.
Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect.
At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver.
The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button.
Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.

Biggest pro:
The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"Not bad for the price.
The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad.",0

Electronics_5,3,OR,"Pros- Great picture, slim design, light weight, 3d conversion is pretty cool.
Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.

I was concerned ONLY about the issue regarding the hinge but as just about every laptop has a downside I thought I'd risk it. Well I'm feeling pretty bad about this because though the price seems good for the specs a $1200 laptop is not budget and the three things I depend on every time I turn on the unit is DISPLAY, TRACKPAD AND KEYBOARD. Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done. Not a soul at ASus has replied to that query. Display was NEVER  a feature I spend alot of time on before because displays just did what displays should do but this yellow tint on the unit that so many other complain of that I didn't realise before makes my eyes hurt.

Electronics_5,3,OR,"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

The only downside is that it's very small. The mount is designed to be a little too large for a regular tripod. It's not a huge deal, but it is very heavy for such a small mount.

When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked.

Note 1: Apple products use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa.

This cheapness keeps me from losing it when my earphones ""disappear"" several times a week. I was getting a few other things on Amazon and decided to try these. and guess what? THEY ARE AWESOME! I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these.

I knew this cover wasn't leather (unfortunately), but once I touched it I was disappointed in the feel of it.  Yes it is soft and smooth, but it looks and feels like plastic ""Pleather.""

The original ads looked promising, but they have just one problem: little of this will work for you. The main problem of this kit is that you're very unlikely to force it doing anything useful.

THE GOOD
-Sensors and the hub look better than many other plastic junk boxes out there.
-The customer support works great. +1 star for that.
-Bundled ""things"" are very easy to connect.
-It sometimes works.

THE BAD
-The app has a decent look, but a terrible design: it's very confusing and often feels stupid.
-To make things worse the app will prompt you to buy extra stuff without being able to run a single scenario.
-Scenarios (here they're called apps) are both useless and confusing. Just need to pair a motion sensor and light? Good luck finding an easy way to do that.
-Sonos and Philips HUE support works. Only in beta. And only if you consider such (mis)behavior a ""work"".
-Bundled manual refers to the old version of the app. But who cares if it's useless anyway?

THE UGLY
-I've spent nearly 40 minutes trying to connect the hub to the app. I'm neither mentally limited nor twisted handed, but the whole process is so confusing that I'm not sure I'll be able to repeat it again.

Well I have had this camera for 1.5 years and have to say it takes amazing pictures.
It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brands and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere.
Fits well into small bags, purses etc

Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one.....
There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... has been a nightmare...... sigh!!
I wasted tons of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size.
Tried a few camera stores and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded....
That means I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap.
What a ""post-purchase"" drag this has been!
Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brands now that have more main stream camera parts so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle......

It fits nicely, and seems to be pretty thin (which I wanted). My only slight complaint is that it isn't exactly what I'd call RED red. It's more of a dusty red, or a very dark pink. Kind of rosy, perhaps? Anyways, it actually works out okay for me because it matches the red portion of my Supcase Unicorn Beetle black/red case very VERY well. It's really hard to match reds, and the red of the case isn't particularly red, either. However, the color of the case and cover are so close as to pretty much be the same, which is great for me. A tiny ring of red now peeks out around the case's camera hole. I'm about to upload a picture, check it out. I think it looks pretty damn good. On a side note, and it doesn't bother me at all for my purposes - the cover isn't exactly what I'd call rubberized. I was expecting something perhaps a little grippy and more textured, but the cover is basically just matte finish.

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.",0
Electronics_5,4,CG,"I'm not usually a traditional web designer, but I decided to try this one for the first time. I had a lot of trouble with the basic design of the keyboard, especially the color. I tried the color on a white background and it was very disappointing. I would have preferred a more vibrant color with a tactile feel, but the color was not there. It was also very difficult to set up with the touch screen. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it was very easy to forget to turn on the touch screen when typing on it, which is a big problem with this keyboard. I do recommend it for anyone who wants a simple keyboard for their work. I have been using a gb 3x2 for over a year and have had no problems. This is my second gb 3x2 and I use it in the past and have had no problems with the addition of a screen protector. I use this with a Canon 5D Mark II and this has worked great for me. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good gb 3x2. I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.  The pad is exceptional for traction or laser.

I currently have two testable units.. a 15""+ PC and 8""+ netbook.  It's great for both, but the larger proves that this desk is the perfect fit as it is invisible once placed.  Usage appeal for me is, ironically, in bed.  I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.

If you have been following the other reviews, the video quality is poor and the sound is not as good as other earbuds.

I have a pair of Sony earbuds that I would recommend for the price.  I would definitely recommend this item.

I highly recommend this product.I like that it has a feature where you can purchase a single USB drive for the price of the extender. It does work though, but only if you have a USB drive.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"You know, I have invested in quite a few very expensive ear buds in the past.  They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.

I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.

Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.

I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.

So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.  They are decent at excluding outside noise, though I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as I had on some of the higher priced phones.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.

While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

Picture: super bright amazing image quality for the price point this tv will not disappoint! Extremely customizable image settings allow you to adjust the picture just how you want it.

When wall mounted or pushed up against the wall the sound sounds tinny like how your cellphone speaker sounds when placed speaker down on a table.

Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).",0

The drive is not very compact and it has not been able to hold up with the current typing.  I have the TRS-80 on the left and the TRS-80 on the right and they are both very close to each other.  The drive is also very loud and seems to be very portable.  The TRS-80 has a magnetic feature and the TRS-80 has a feature on the left that makes it easier to use the keyboard.  I have not tried it with the TRS-80 and I have no idea what they have in store for it.

It is a nice size and well made.  I would not hesitate to buy this again if I could.  It has a lot of features and it is very well made.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.

The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.

All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.

The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable. Corsair could and should have spent the little bit more money and made the connectors 4 pin.",0

The ear buds don't fit comfortably in the ear, so it's a little difficult to pair them. If you have a pair of ear buds, you may need to put them on your head and them on the head and then adjust the volume/angle. I just turned the volume up to the right and it didn't work.

Electronics_5,1,OR,"Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.",0

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.",0

I have an LG 60LB6300 60-Inch TV and at the very least you can remove this from the box, sit it on the entertainment center below the TV, plug it and the sub in and that's it. With my TV I can send the audio wirelessly which worked well, but I chose the optical cable instead. Even with the optical cable the sound bar turns on and off automatically without exception. The sub syncs by itself, and Bluetooth worked great but I only used it when I first opened the box to hear the sound from this bar. One thing I noticed is it was recommended for 43"" and smaller tvs. This may be due to length, however I mounted it in the center of the TV with the included wall mount, and if centered properly it looks perfect. It is pretty loud as well, we usually have the volume between 15 and 25 out of 100.  I have the sub turned down and in a corner behind my couch (it just needs a wall outlet) and also sounds good.  The bar itself adjusts with the TV volume which displays on the TV when adjusted. Basically I never have to touch the sound bar or use it's remote (which is a good thing cause I haven't seen it in a month). One caveat with the wall mount is the optical cable plugs in on one side of the mount than has an opening for the wire to go into the wall on the other side.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"Bought this because I thought it was time to upgrade my old Harmony One. The physical Harmony Home remote is fantastic. I love the simple design, love the fact that you can program buttons to do two different things depending on if you long press or short press. Love that it's RF. If Logitech threw an LCD and backlight on this thing, it would be the best remote they've ever created.

Where the problems begin is there's no LCD on the remote. Your smartphone is supposed to take on that task and unfortunately, the app that makes this possible just sucks. Sometimes it's slow to connect to the hub, sometimes it crashes, sometimes the hub just stops responding to it. More often than not, I would grab the OEM remotes because it was so much faster and less frustrating. That's not a good sign.

I actually managed to put up with the app for a while, but the thing that had me running back to my Harmony One was when something gets out of sync (happens more than you think), there's no ""help"" button on the remote. I had to dig my phone out, unlock it, launch the app, wait for it to find the hub, hope the app doesn't crash, then fix the sync problem. This would take me 2 seconds to fix with my old Harmony One. With Harmony Home, it takes a good minute.

I don't like the direction Logitech is going with the smartphone thing. They need to focus on making good physical remotes. Does anyone really enjoy using their smartphone as remote? It's clumsy and takes too long to do anything with. I cringed every time I needed to launch the Harmony app to do something. I need tactile buttons Logitech!",0

I'm not sure how much of a improvement they can make but I don't think they should.  They sound great and I'm pleased with the sound.  If I had to guess, I'd say the sound quality is decent.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because they are very small, but I'd be happy with them if they were small enough.

I'm not sure if the speaker is that bad because it's only about 10"" wide.  The reason I give this 5 stars is because I don't like the way the sound is wired.  I was able to find some cable that worked for the price but I never heard of it.  If I had known that I could just buy a different cable that worked, I'd probably buy a different set of speakers.

UPDATE:  I contacted the seller to see if they would send me a replacement pair of speakers.  They told me that they would not and I was able to order one of these.  I was able to send them a replacement pair of speakers but I still have a problem.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.",0

I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.

I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I'm not sure if I'd really call this ""high gain"", but thanks to its antenna and USB extension cord, it does a better job of pulling in wi-fi signals than your typical ""nano"" or compact USB wi-fi adapter. The box contains the adapter, which looks like an oversize USB flash drive; screw-on antenna, a USB extension cord that's maybe 2 feet long, and a mini CD containing the drivers.

One minuscule quibble: Like most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with a cap intended to protect the USB plug when the adapter is not in use. And, like most USB wi-fi adapters, it has no means for stowing or otherwise retaining that cap when the adapter IS in use. My guess is that most people eventually lose the cap. This is of no real consequence except, perhaps, aesthetics.

The best improvement in wi-fi performance is achieved by using the provided extension cord to position the adapter above and away from your computer, where it can get the best possible signal. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't buy your own USB extension cord and use that to improve the signal with a more conventional USB wi-fi adapter. But the antenna, which actually contains metal parts configured in a way that really does boost the gain, still gives the TL-WN722N an edge over a nano adapter with an extension cord.

As with most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with unneeded wi-fi management software. (Most wi-fi management software has been superfluous since Windows XP Service Pack 3 gave Windows robust, built-in wi-fi management.) Unlike with some other adapters, there is no way to install just the drivers you need while omitting the management software that you don't need. But after it's installed, you can set Windows as the wi-fi manager.",0
Electronics_5,2,CG,"This doesn't really fit the bill. The only way to fix it is to just throw the one in a bag.  The plastic part needs to be re-attached to the lens cap to make it fit.  The camera will only use one lens at a time.

I haven't used it with a Nikkor, but I do like it a lot.  I wish I could buy a lens cap for it, but I don't think I'll have to do that.

The other issue I have with it is that it doesn't fit the lens hood.  The hood is a good thing, because it's kind of stiff.  I wish I had found one that was a bit bigger.

Overall, this camera is a good value and I'd recommend it to anyone.  I'd probably buy another if I could.

I don't recommend this camera to anyone unless you already own a camera.  I don't know if you'll be getting this camera for free, but if you do, it's worth the money.I love it!Great sound.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.",0

I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality.

Electronics_5,1,OR,"Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)
Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)

If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed.

Cons: Cheap, toy feel

There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof.

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.

I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is truly a fantastic little class d amp with good clarity and enough punch to drive a few bass notes.

I have used a variety of these little class d type amps over the years to drive aux sound in spare rooms, garage and the like.  Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped.
now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.

When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.

Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.

Do not hesitate - grab one of these units now before they realize it should be priced higher!!",0
Electronics_5,4,CG,"I had considered the WPi, but the fact that it was a 64 bit drive makes this one a little more affordable. The drive itself is 32 bit, and the MBR is 64 bit. The MBR is in the same format as the Win7 64 bit drive.

I had a 2TB WD Media Writer and it worked great. I had to start up Win7 64 bit to get the MBR to work. The MBR was all I could get out of Win7 64 bit, but I was able to get it to work on my Win7 64 bit machine. I had to restart Win7 64 bit to get it to work.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).
  Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?
  Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).
  One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports. Came with 2 5ft. Ethernet cables.  BTW, sound fading problem has disappeared, thanks to this great product!",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I've heard these speakers at my local computer store. These are the best sounding among all the brands offered. Klipsch didn't sound as good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component looks very sturdy. There are three possible connections - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers?  I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System  DAV-C990 which I returned after two weeks because the speakers are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons:
1. The speaker cords are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote needs aesthetic improvement. These speakers have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lovers will adore these for their games and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality. Even Apple has adapted these speakers for their upcoming G5 desktops. And if someone knows good design, these people do.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.",0

One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].

It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.

With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This thing is awesome! I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.  I know that AIO's also run the potential of leaking,  but I feel that your chances are much lower.  Good luck everyone.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I have not used the AAA Lacrosse batteries that came with the unit.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them... I'll never buy another PNY product again). I bought this XFX 6450 instead and I am glad I did. It is without question a much better card. Well worth the $$ !! Buy one!!",0

Electronics_5,1,OR,"First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

As such, I cannot recommend these",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"(Written by Joseph's wife, Shiloh)

I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.

Pros:
-Easy set up.
-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.
-Comes with a in-car charger.
-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).
-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.

Cons:
-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.
-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.
-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with this product. I wasn't expecting it to be flawless, and it has been satisfactory thus far (though I have not had it long). I will update this in a few months when I have used it more!",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Buyer beware when use with some USB-C to USB-C cable, you might get speed capped 40MB/s:

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"Denons ear-bud headphones are simple, comfortable to wear, and offer high sound quality.

The Denons are understated, but stylish.  They have polished end caps, with dark chrome accents.  The materials and the fit and finish are high.  Included with the headphones are three silicon ear tips; small, medium, and large.  Also included is a short extension cable, although I am unsure what anyone would need it for.  I never needed it when using the Denons with my iPhone 5s.

The Denons have a small built-in microphone and a single button that is attached a couple of inches down from the right ear-bud.  The button allows you to control music playback and take calls/use voice command.  Its very intuitive and simple to use.

Sound quality of the Denons is high.  I listened to all types of music, from jazz, to country, to pop and all of it sounded nice.  Bass was strong without being overpowering, and high were also nicely rendered.  Overall, I found they produced very balanced and attractive sound.  Since the Denons close off the opening of the ear canal so well I was also able to hear subtle instruments and vocals that I would have missed otherwise.  The one downside of their excellent noise isolation is that I could also hear myself breathing at times.

The Denons are comfortable and I found that the medium sized ear tips fit my average sized ears best.  The headphones fit snuggly, but are never uncomfortable, and even after walking briskly for a mile they only shifted a little bit.  Im not sure they are made for running, but for modest activity levels they should work fine.  They are also light in weight.  The cord is long enough to not tug on the headphones when you move, but not so long that it gets in the way.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products.",0
Electronics_5,4,CG,"UPDATE 04/11/2017: I'm updating my review. The quality of this item is very good, the screen is very bright and the mic is very clear. The sound is great. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I would recommend it for anyone with an iPhone. Great for the price. I have a portable player and I can use the external controls to control the volume. I can set the volume to a level that is too loud for a person to hear. I have a second player that I use for music and I can also control the volume by either a knob or by turning the knob on or off. The only problem I have is that the sound is too weak and the sound is loud. It is a bit noisy to hear, but it's a good speaker. I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones that I use in the car and they are very good. The sound quality is excellent. I use this in my car and it sounds very good. I have used it for a while and it's been great. I would recommend this product to anyone. I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it. It's a little smaller than the typical keyboard, but it's a little lighter than she expected. It works really well for my needs and is well-made. The only thing I wish was that it had a tab to adjust the volume, which it doesn't do. She has this keyboard now for her iPad, but I can't imagine that it's going to be needed for her tablet.",1
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've bought 3 of these cables. The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.

When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.

I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.

PROS:
The price is great.
The cable is well made and thick
Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.

CONS:
I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly...
(Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)

Side note:
Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable.",0

The Define 2 is a perfect replacement for my Logitech Harmony. I would definitely buy it again.Works great. I did not want the cable to fall out of the charger. I didn't want the cable to be bent over and on my charger. It's very easy to insert and close the charger. You can use the cable as a micro USB cable, or just plug it into a wall outlet. I like that it has a small detachable charger that you can leave in the charger for emergencies. I would recommend this product for those of you who are not concerned about your cable.I have a little cable bag that is used with my Kindle Fire.  It is not waterproof, but works well.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I bought this based on reviews, composition and price.
I needed a protective case for my portable HDs and in researching, decided to try this model.  I am not comfortable with soft cases and felt that some form of hard case was necessary for protection.
The case measures externally approximately 7"" x 4-1/4"" x 1-3/4"".  The interior storage cavity measures approximately 6"" x 3-1/2"" x 1-1/2"".
The outer covering is a tight weave synthetic fabric laid over a stiff plastic shell.  All observable stitching is single-stitch.  From what I can feel, the plastic does have some give but is reasonably stiff.
The interior has soft, fabric covered foam padding covering only one flat side and not the edges. It appears to be approximately 1/4"" or less thick.  There is a 1"" wide elastic band for HD retention.
The other side of the interior (which has no foam padding) has a mesh pocket approximately 3"" deep by 3-1/2"" wide.
The exterior of the case has a fabric pocket measuring approximately 3"" x 6-1/2"".  There are no straps or velcro.  The material appears to be some form of thin neoprene.
I noticed in the reviews that some mentioned that the zipper can be faulty.  In my particular case there appears to be no problem and zipping the case open or shut presented no discernable difficulties.  Long-term durability remains to be seen..  The zipper pull has a oblong hard rubber tab attached to it.
This case fits my portable HDs with room to spare.  The elastic band holds the devices securely, although how long it will retain adequate elasticity remains to be seen.
I use the exterior storage pocket for the HD cables as I am not comfortable having the cable with the USB connections rubbing against the HD on the other side of the case interior.
I feel that this case is adequate for casual use but I would like to see if there are cases with foam padding all around.",0

I replaced the old one with this one. I was also frustrated because I had to replace the motherboard with a new one. I did not want to waste the money on a product that could not be used. This board is a nice improvement over the previous one. It's very easy to program and runs very smoothly. I have a few other products for my kids' computers. This one has more features but it is a better value. I have not had a problem with it. I have installed a number of other programs for my Macbook. I like the fact that it does not have a fan.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.

If you care:

You can see my photos with this camera on Flickr at: [...]

The Garmin is very light, and is light enough to be a very reliable source of power.  It does not have a battery, but it does have a charge indicator.  I plugged it in with a USB cable, and the indicator light on the Garmin was light.  I was able to pull it off the Garmin and on my Mac Mini, and I am very pleased with the results.  I have no complaints about the Garmin, and it works great!

Electronics_5,5,OR,"The Garmin ""Bluecharts"" are vector charts, which means they use mathematic algorithms to store all the lines and features of a nautical chart.  I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.
The Garmin application the charts run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types.  I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit.
The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of charts from the CD-ROM.  I'm not sure, but I think it will only work with that specific unit, which worries me a bit as I am thinking about buying a second unit for backup.",0

Electronics_5,1,OR,"Before purchasing I was a little leary, both of the bright room concerns voiced earlier and of buying from an Amazon associated company, not Amazon itself.  Purchasing a month ago, both fears were unfounded.

Electronic Express was fine, shipping on Monday after a Friday order via FedEx Ground.  The box was strapped vertically to a pallet and the driver helped removing it from the pallet and using a hydraulic platform to get it to the ground and into the house.  Net result:  no shipping nor delivery problems.  The set worked perfectly upon arrival.

As to the picture and operations, I have it on an HDMI connection from a DirecTV HD satellite connection.  The black level is as astonishing as they advertise and the picture as clean and crisp as I observed earlier (at a Sears where they had this, the Sharp and the Sony side-by-side, with the Samsung as good as the Sony and much better than the Sharp).

We are in Florida, where the sun is known to be particularly bright and this room has huge western sky facing windows.  There is a little sun glare and reflection in the very late afternoon but all parts of the screen are still easily viewable and after a few minutes any annoyance from glare and reflection is tuned out by one's eyes.  In sort, there's no problem here with the issue.

Highly recommended for the price and overall quality.

Addendum (December 2009):  Well, a month after the warranty expired, so did this product.  I had an authorized Samsung repair shop look at it and the LCD drivers had failed.  Great, I thought, a simple circuit board change.  WRONG!  That circuit board was ""married"" to the display so the entire display needed to be replaced.  $1500 plus labor!  Short result:  the Samsung was junked and a reliable Sony replacement purchased.  Star rating reflects the unconscionable cost of repair of a somewhat simple problem.",0

Electronics_5,3,OR,"Potentially good earphones with two major issues. I can rate them 2.5 to 3 stars based on the units I received.
First of all, the construction quality is really good. Buttons, earbuds, cables, eartips - everything is made of very good quality. The aluminium case is another pleasant bonus.
Speaking of sound quality, it's good but not great. I felt the bass is weak even after tweaking equalizer on my laptop as well as phone. Audio (especially music) feels little flat as compared to other earphones I tested. Having said that, it doesn't mean it's bad and is surely acceptable for daily use. The volume controls operate individually (independent of source volume) so that's a very good feature. Range is very good. I didn't notice audio breaking while walking away from source unless I went too far. As compared to other earphones I've tested, these have larger bluetooth range.
Two major issues these earphones have are battery life and in-ear fit. In-ear fit is not quite good. It keeps falling off the ears even after trying all eartips and earfins. I found mid-sized eartips better fitting than others. It's certainly manageable when you are doing a desk top and not moving around much. They fell off once when I was walking around in office. Battery life is the biggest disappointment. The earphones get fully charged in less than 2 hours (as is the case with most of other earphones) but I got ""battery level medium"" audio prompt within first half hour of use. I used then for another 40 minutes and I got ""battery low"" prompt and within few minutes they switched off as battery was completely off. So I could use them for less than 1.5 hours after fully charging them. I'm not sure if the battery issue is by design or if the units I received have this defect.
Conclusion - These earphones surely have potential but aforementioned two major issues disappoint you. If they at least had good battery life, they surely deserve 4.5 stars.",0

Electronics_5,2,OR,"I initially had high hopes for this product.  I have an HTPC with Windows Media Center that has built in Hauppauge tuners (one PCI single, 1500 series I think, and a dual PCIEx1 2250 model).  I was thinking that eventually, I'd be able to not be stuck with routing coax cables to the computer, and be able to access the tuner content over the network.  It worked pretty well for about 10 months.

The first one didn't work and after a hassle-free Amazon return, the second one broke after about 10 months.  The cooling fan stopped working and it was so hot to the touch, it was making my closet smell like burnt electronics.  I'm surprised it didn't catch on fire (not sure if it is UL listed or not.)  And like most warranties, you have to send it to the manufacturer and pay the shipping.  Yawn.  I guess I could have bought a new one and send the old one back, but that is somewhat unethical, and I didn't want to risk a house fire anyway, so at this point, I don't think you could pay me to take one.

The cooling fan in this unit is very loud, so it would need to be tucked away and not in the main viewing area.

On the other hand the Hauppauge tuners have performed flawlessly for probably about 5 years.  As a bonus, the Hauppauge also acts as my IR input to my computer which enables easy integration with Evenghost for automation with my Harmony remotes.  As a con, it seems the Hauppauge dual tuner has the worst signal, the single has slightly better, and the HDHomeRun had the best.  So if Hauppauge could better manage the ATSC signal in the tuner, there would be a clear winner there.  But even so, low heat, no noise, and flawless operation over 5 years is a large upside.

Bottom line, I will not purchase or consider this unit again.",0

A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.",0

Electronics_5,3,OR,"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.",0

3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.

8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones. The main downside is you can find unbranded versions of these headphones for ~$20 on Amazon, still with Prime shipping.",0

However, I just received a pair of the same headphones, both with different sound and the same subwoofer.  They both sound great.  I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works well and seems to last for quite a while.

It does not seem to work well with my gb12x2.  I would recommend it for those who use their gb12x2 and want to use it with their laptop.I've had a few of these for a few months now, and haven't had any problems.

Electronics_5,4,OR,"I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I purchased the Olympus VN 6200PC years ago, so I decided to compare it with the newer Olympus VN-722PC.

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3.",0

The plastic parts are also very light and easy to remove, and the plastic part is still very durable. I am very pleased with the quality of the case. The only thing I would change is to the color of the caps. I am very happy with this case. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a case that protects the camera, and does not provide extra storage space for other items. I bought this for my wife to use with her iPad mini and it works perfectly. She loves it!  She doesn't have a lot of space to store anything other than the iPad, but I don't need to worry about that. She uses it for a lot of things, including drawing, pictures, etc. She loves it!Works perfectly, no problems with the software or even my keyboard.

Electronics_5,2,OR,"I wanted to revitalize my early 2011 MacBook Pro.  The drive itself works mostly as expected (about 12% slower than its specs).  But the installation was arduous and can be expensive.

First, the drive is formatted for Windows and all the software provided is Windows only.  So you need to use Disk Manager to erase the disk, rename it to something meaningful, and reformat it to Mac OS Extended Journaled.  Then you need a piece of software like Carbon Copy Cloner to mirror your existing hard disk onto the new SSD.  CCC is a great software package, which you should probably own anyway for various backup tasks, but if you don't already have it, buying it adds to the expense of the upgrade.

The provided installation guide is a pamphlet of 8 pictures for installing on a desktop, 6 pictures for installing on a laptop, and 1 frame of cautions.  All very generic and useless for my MacBook Pro.  By the way, both sets of pictures show a SATA-to-USB adapter cable for cloning, which was not included and must be purchased separately.

The installation requires a 7mm to 9.5mm space adapter for 2.5 drives.  Again this is an additional purchase as the Samsung SSD is more shallow than the original drive.  The actual physical installation involves removing the cover, removing the drive clamp and old drive, removing the 4 stud screws on the old drive and putting them onto the SSD, applying the spacer (be sure to orient the drive to the cable connector before adhering it), seating the drive (it still seemed a little loose), re-installing the drive clamp and replacing the cover.  The studs are required on the new drive to make sure it seats into the clamp.  Why Samsung couldn't spend an extra $.0005 and include these on the SSD is unknown.

So, overall 4 stars for the drive, 0 stars for the lack of Mac installation support and the required accessory expenses, averaging out to 2 stars for this review.",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This CPU was too fast.

Amazon needs a way to prevent OUIs (ordering under the influence). One morning not long ago I woke up with a terrible hangover, not quite sure what happened the night before. Upon checking my email that morning, I noticed a shipment notification for a Intel Core i7-3930K Hexa-Core Processor. I realized I must have ordered in a drunken blur, and through the haze I indeed remembered placing some kind of order.

I was shocked, but decided to go ahead and let the order go through. After all, I had been debating this purchase for weeks and just didn't want to shell out the dough for this wicked CPU. After all, I told myself, I already had a quad-core 2700k overclocked to 5 GHZ, why would I need the 3930k with six cores and amazing stats?

But it was on the way. The 2700k at 5 GHZ was already a beast, and I found through practice I could reign it in and handle it, so thought I was ready for this 3930k and its hexacore awesomeness... well I was wrong.

To make a long story short, the power of my PC outfit with this CPU literally destroyed my mind. It was far, far beyond my control. I wrestled it for hours in epic battles through various intense games and applications, certain I could reign it in, but in the end it left me a quivering, sweating mass, as blood and drool sprayed forth from me in profuse waves. I don't want to go into the detail of the things I saw while this CPU rendered 12 threads of everything I threw at it at billions of calculations per second, but suffice it to say mortal human minds can't handle it.

In summary, I am sending it back -- it is too fast. I need to give it 5 stars because it is truly amazing. Words of advice: Do not OUI, and do not think other fast CPUs you have used have in any way prepared you for this one -- they have not.",0

Electronics_5,4,OR,"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating.

Electronics_5,3,OR,"I had a sony P-200 camera 7.2mp to replace it with the Canon. My friend bought a Canon G-7 to replace the Sony (We have the Same Sony Camera). We both got in to the hype of all the reviews. We both tested the canon cameras quite a bit. Both Canon(s) has more options then the Sony does. But the Sony overall picture is much sharper and the colors are more realistic and natural. I kept my Canon just cause I was in so deep, I had already received a 8 gig SDHC Card, had a rebate on the Epson Printer so I ended up keeping the Canon and sold the Sony. It was a hard choice, knowing the sony picture quality is that much better. My friend on the other hand is selling his New Canon G-7, ""too bulky and its not worth it to lug it around when the Sony P-200 takes better sharper pics."" I agree, the Sony picture quality is better then the Canon 850IS. I can affirm that! The only thing is the Sony takes average low light pics, but the Canon 850is is no world beater in that department either. When it comes to day light shots, the Sony wins hands down over the 850is and also according to my friend the sony beats the Canon G-7 in outdoor photos ""not zoomed"". Like I said the Canon(s) has more options, and some might counter that you need to manaual play with the canon to get a better pic. But really who wants to mess with manual settings on a trip overseas? How many pics will you miss? The Sony P-200 has as fast boot up as the Canon 850IS and takes pics much much faster with the flash when it comes to multiple pics. And the sony flat out takes better pics. No doubt the canon is a excellent camera, but its questionable as to how good compared with a sony that came out in 2005...the Sony has less options, but has great image quality and ""sony Style"".",0

Electronics_5,5,OR,"This review is for the charger purchased for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right?
So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time?
I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!
 I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it.",0

I am no professional. I had used a basic DSLR prior to this the k2000. So this review is based on someone upgrading from a beginner SLR to a more sophisticated one.

Pros:

Low light: This is a camera that takes great low light pictures, you can push the ISO up pretty high and still get great pictures. This was the biggest reason for me to upgrade. I had a hard time taking pictures of my kids in various performances with terrible lighting conditions. Obviously one needs a good lens. But with my old camera I had to throw too many away. This camera combined with the DA 50-135mm lens is one terrific package for such situations.

Weight/Size: this is the most compact camera at such a level that you will find.

Weather resistant: This is a weather resistant camera! Combine this with a weather resistant lens and you are all set.

Electronic Level: I thought this was a gimmick but after using it for a few days, I find it indispensable to take level photos.

User Selectable Focus points: these are standard in expensive cameras, nothing special if you have used such cameras before but for somone upgrading I quickly found out how convenient this was.

Shake reduction: Pentax unlike Nikon/Canon has shake reduction built into the camera, so any lens you put on it has shake reduction function.

Lenses: Pentax has small pancake lenses called limited lenses. Try these if you are new to Pentax. They are superb and great to walk around with without looking like a dork.

Cons: Expensive...",0

I bought the 16 GB version because I thought it was good for a little more storage.  So, I bought the 32 GB version because it was easy to install, so I would be able to use it for more.  The 32 GB version was very easy to install.  I don't have any issues with it since I have never had any issues with it.  I just bought a second one for my second computer and this one works great.  I bought the 32 GB version because it is very easy to install and works great.  I also bought the 32 GB version because it is very easy to use.  I can use this mouse for my iPhone or iPad and the 16 GB version works great.  I don't have any problems with it because I do not have the iPhone or iPad in my computer.

Electronics_5,5,OR,"I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar...",0
Electronics_5,5,CG,"If you work in an office or you want to make sure your computer is up to date, this is an excellent choice. I am using it with the TRS-80 and it does not require a power adapter.

I would recommend this product.I purchased this device for my sister to use as a remote control for her Sony A-100.  I've had this device for a few years and I love it.  The sound is excellent and the sound quality is great.  I would highly recommend this device.I've owned these for about a month now and have had no problems with them.  They do exactly what I wanted them to do.  They sound good and are easy to use.  I've had no problems with them at all.  I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a good pair of headphones.I've been using this on a Lenovo Thinkpad XPS 13.  I've had it for a few months and it seems to be working fine.  The only issue is that it's not wireless so you need to use a bluetooth headset.  However, the sound quality is very good and I can hear the keyboard very well.  I would recommend this product.I've had a lot of troubles with the sound.  The sound is very good and the bass is good.  But, I didn't like the sound of the speakers.  I really liked the fact that the sound is good, but the sound is not good enough.  This was a very easy problem to solve.  I'd recommend this speaker for anyone looking for a good sound system.I bought this camera to take a picture of the landscape view of my family Christmas tree. ",1
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned.",0
