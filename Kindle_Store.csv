Kindle_Store_5,1,OR,This set of books is nothing but poorly written pornography.  At least have enough respect to edit your writing.  A responsibly placed comma or an appropriate capital letter does wonders.  Honestly the poor literary examples and every other page containing porn were more than enough not to complete this over advertised accumulation of pond scum.  Not to mention the storyline seems to copy that of a best selling novel and its movie.,0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This had great bickering between the hero and heroine. The heroine had been abandoned by her people when she was just 9 years old for being unusual while the hero's talent allowed him to be embraced by his clan. A nice source of tension.

The romance is good even if the sexy times are behind close doors.

We also get lovely little treats-lectures on alien cultures and the wonderful healing pets and their adorable fluff ball babies. The reveal of the real reason for the title is much fun.

Very good Science Fiction Romance reading.",0

Mackenzie was broken in other ways. I felt for her. They had an emotional journey. One that was worth it in the end.

Morgan Mandel does a great job at keeping us turning the pages as we discover Dorrie's problems and wonder how she will react. The villains are great too, each with a convincing motivation to explain their actions. This is the first book in a series and we can't wait for the others.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,Finally Declan and Harper get their story!! I enjoyed going back to Hell to see Declan get his fiesty independent woman. Watching single mom Harper give in and give her heart a chance was something I could totally relate to. It wasn't easy for these two to come together but nothing is in the tiny town of Hell but you will totally root for them. And it was nice to get updates on the friends who are family to Declan and Harper. A hot read I definitely recommend. A little slow to get going but an enjoyable stand alone read.,0

So it was to that kind of place to which this book took me back, certainly as the character Cherie describes her desire to order up the perfect man, and then goes on a funny and insightful journey of eroticism, rejection, conflict, confusion and pulling it all together again. This book was a very enjoyable elixir.",0

I'm trying to figure out if the other reviews and I read the same book.  The story was kinda disjointed.  The conversations between characters didn't feel like any conversations I have heard before, not at all believable.  Almost like reading a book badly translated from another language.  Weird.  You wanted to sympathize with Tony because he was trying to do the right things for his daughter, but his thought process didn't fit his character.  Cassi is sometimes way to flakey to be believable.  The book is rather disappointing.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I love westerns and the premise drew me in. This is the first book I've read by Elizabeth Rose and I am looking forward to reading more. She captured the Old West with a descriptive and believable setting. Rena dresses as a boy and helps her brother, who is falsely convicted of murder, escape the gallows. Now she has the bounty hunter on her tail!

I felt connected to the spunky heroine and the hero who is surprisingly a bounty hunter. While this was a clean romance I did feel the sparks building at the end of the story and had wished it was a bit longer to show more of the budding romance.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"My rating: 5 of 5 stars

This is Susanne O`learys latest book which I've had the greatest of pleasure in reading as an ARC.
Isn't the cover great!
I love this author as she's taken a different chance on this story, more intense and romantically raw in my opinion with things to hide that come out later as you read further on into the pages.

I liked this one as much as I loved her previous book Hot Property. This isn't a carry on from that, its a stand alone book in its own right.
Its taken me today to sit down and read this lovely enjoyable read.
Susanne never disappoints her readers, yet another thumbs up from me.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Technically, this is a romantic suspense which actually kept me guessing until the three-quarters of the book yet the love story Alan Mellington and Sarah Montgomery remained first and foremost in the storyline.

The serendipitous way they found each other and how their love for each other developed despite the social class barrier of early 19th century England is worth the read. Even the zealousness of a misguided local religious leader and how gossip leading to slander can hurt the innocent were described with no holds bar.

There is also good discussion about faith which will interest Christian readers.

This book is PG 13 due to situational drama. There are no sex scenes in this book.",0

While I do believe that opposites attract, the fact is people do not change over night and, least of all, someone who has grown in such a black and white world as Chandler. I can understand that the book length meant that there would not be much of a plot and it could feel rushed, but I have read shorter stories that have worked for me. I just don't buy the plot or the characters.",0

'Nefarious', 'Ruthless' and 'T Wave' were all full of deceit, suspense, thrilling scenarios, romance and an abundance of characters who fit the role of 'bad guys'. Alton and Mallory make such a great team. They truly compliment each other and their strengths make them the ideal couple. David and Fahima are such an awesome couple. Their romance was so endearing.

She is exploring her own desires and sexuality as a woman. You should not be embarrassed about your sexuality and any fantasies that you have and by the end of this book, I think she came to terms with that. Tanner of course helps her with her self discovery. Her passion excites him and it just brings them closer together. Can't wait for the next one. Only two left. I'll be sad when it ends.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This is a great courtroom drama, with detailed analysis of the characters involved. No character is a stereotype, with some approaching pure evil and others somewhat good, but all the characters are believable and their behavior consistent. Turk is very adept at providing just the right level of detail to convey his message. The story and its ending are groaningly realistic. The good guys don't always win, and evil sometimes prevails. Perverted and unusual sex are on display, but not graphic. The message is delivered in good taste, but still delivered. The courtroom action itself is spell-binding, and makes it impossible to break from reading. Give this book a read, you won't be disappointed.",0

Sweet romance is probably a better term for the writer's style.  She has an eye for detail that brings the people to life.  And she has an eye for attraction so she can communicate it in suble ways.

The opening was executed with precision leaving me a bit stunned. And then there is the promise dictated by the Book of Hours- find true love; something most of us want, so it keeps you reading and digging your heels in. This book has some of everything-love, desire, betrayal and even show biz. Dangerous Liaisons indeed.

I found the cast likeable, and the alternating timeline helped to build suspense around what's really happening at the University.

The romance is a slow burn by necessity, but is very much secondary to the storyline until it's really thrown in James' face what he's been doing all this time. Watching him have to re-evaluate everything he's understood in his life and slowly struggle with new insights (and that he might not be as good a man as he's thought) is the real story of the book, despite the high fantasy surrounding it.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I received a copy of this book in exchange for a review. There is so much emotional upheaval in this last book. Cassie having to deal with the ramifications of her assault and Cody's reaction that results with him being temporarily separated from her. Rather unjustly but when has anything ever been easy for these two.  How their love is the only thing gives them the strength they need to deal with the difficult times. Willa-Mae and Mike providing them with the space and support they both needed. Inspiring. A large box of tissues is a must have before you sit down to read this last installment. You will not be disappointed. Look forward to reading more stories from L.G. Castillo.,0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,This book is unusual to say the least. The beginning keeps you guessing for a while as strange events start to happen to Evie. You start to get little hints about what is happening until your teased with thoughts of the greek gods. What happens when the gods are threatened? well there is an unusual theory in this book. My curiosity kept me going and by the end I found myself really interested in what was going to happen to poor Evie. Is she going to make it? Will she come to terms with what is happening to her or will her mortal body fail? I guess I'm going to have to find out lol. There is explicit adult content and violence.,0

I wasn't sure what to expect with a hero living as a woman in his step-mother's home, but I ended up loving Cinder's humor and innocence. From glass slippers to fairy godmothers, evil step-sisters and Prince Charming, all aspects of the classic tale are there, just with a clever twist for the mm romance reader.
When Cinder goes to the ball in a beautiful gown and meets the prince, I was so nervous for him!!
Without giving anything away, Cinder gets his happily ever after....whether or not he's still wearing dresses though I won't say, LOL.

This was a super quick, sweet little read that follows a jaded journalist and a male romance novelist. I was a bit shocked at the length of this book -- I wanted more and wasn't expecting it to be novella length! Sara Hantz writes extremely well -- the dialogue was easy to follow and it was easy to get lost in the feelings of Sheridan and Mac. The reader goes through the entire emotional wheel with Sheridan as she's told she's not getting the assignment she wants, and then through her falling process.

Like I said, I wish it had been longer, but this is a good taste at the writing of Sara Hantz",0

The stories, as indicated by the book's title, are grim, dealing with issues such as mortality, helplessness, identity and revenge. The story that resonated with me the most was The Promise, which partnered innocence with malignant intent. The resolution is tragic.

The stories are arranged in segments: Short, Shorter and Shortest. For me, the Shortest stories are presented more as ideas than as full tales, and need more content. However, the ideas are solid.

It's interesting to see how our view of ourselves are projected onto how we think others see us. We look at the outward appearance, what a person has or looks like and we do long to be like them but in reality, they are hurting as well just a little better at hiding it.

One of the  things I liked most is the vivid imagery conveyed by the author--much of it capturing the beauty of the natural world. I could almost feel the cool moist mountain air, smell the musty earth of a cave, the pungent scent from a stand of pines, and the sea spray at Chesapeake Bay. The author also has a great ability to conjure up emotions--some tender and sweet, others sad and melancholy. Suspense, too, anger, fear and a whole lot of nostalgia as his characters relive moments from their past, or as childhood friends fly kites and chase butterflies longing to fly. A thoroughly enjoyable collection.",0

Resentment was a fabulous debut from Nicole London and I can't wait to get my hands on more. I pretty much read this in one sitting and just couldn't get enough. It was a mix of a bunch of my favorite tropes and I just kept hitting next on my Kindle because I was so engrossed in the story of Mia and Dean. Resentment was angsty and sexy and the chemistry between Mia and Dean was explosive.

There were a few things that occurred that had me marking this as a 4 star read rather than a 5 but believe me, this book is good. I highly recommend.",0
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I started out excitedly reading this novel but soon lost interest.  In fact, it took me several months to finally finish it.  I felt the author treated the main characters like cardboard cutouts:  there was no real life to them and they acted very stereotypically.  Also, I thought that the plot would jerk forward at times leaving out important details.  Finally, the plot seemed too far-fetched to have happened in the deep south.  Would a plantation owner's daughter really have been a slave runner and married a Native American man?  And after William killed Thomas with an arrow I do not think that he would have remained alive.  Other plantation owners would have hunted him down and killed him in real life, I believe.",0
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"So-so.  That's how'd I'd describe this romance collection.

As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.

The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even.

If you are interested in historical accuracy and developed characters, skip this one.  If you want a story to entertain you on a rainy afternoon, it will do the trick just fine.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Author, Tim Nolen, captures the genre of superhero literature and then puts a humorous twist on it. His wonderfully thought out band of underdogs manage to battle their way from one encounter to the next on their way to stopping the evil plans of Blackheart, the story's main antagonist, using team work and creative use of their limited super powers. Nolen's creations were true to the usual superhero tropes we've come to expect from superhero fiction, but they don't come off as dry or unbelievable. Of course, the human elements of our heroes.. mainly the back and forth banter, gallows humor, and even sexual under currents, add to the story without distracting the reader.

About half the narrative is devoted to the difficult connection and varying love interests of Kam.  She never really commits.  I'm surprised Seth wants a woman who is so unsure.

As detectives or spies, neither of them amount to much.  They cannot even trace a vehicle, though they seem to know this is possible.  And they go off half cocked and unprepared.  Even down into a mine without a map or a clue, followed by elves with guns.  The resolution, i.e. the identity of the bad guy, is contrived.  He doesn't exist in the plot until the end.  It wasn't terrible, I'd say OK.",0

This story was not just about the zombie apocalpse but was a metaphor for what will happen when we allow too much of the government to interfere by accepting the mark of the beast. It also shows what will hapen when the government no longer cares or is invloved in our lives the way we need them to. What happens when we are truly left alone. There are several verses from the bible sprinkled through the book. Each chapter giving us a lesson. Each lesson hidden well enough as to not interfere with the story or turn you off.

This is not a story for everyone, but it is one that makes you think. The story taps into the vile and demented part of the human experience, one that hides deep within and most of us will never act upon. The author makes you question what would it take for you to reach, to awaken that suppressed side of us all. The side that is shrouded, hiding the vile, callous, and sadistic behaviors buried deep but innate within us all.

Supercharged made me love Max even more and it even made me want to reread Quarter Mile Hearts because I missed this world so much. There were times I was extremely frustrated with Max because he kept trying to fit in instead of just marching to the beat of his own drum.

I'm a little tired of the cliche storyline where the woman doesn't want to get involved with cop/firefighter/generic hero because of the possibility of future loss.

I suppose there is a possibility that Simpson did confess. It simply seems to me that given that the author admits to having made up stories about Simpson in the past, the credibility of this interview is questionable. The book is well written, and for that , I'll give it 3 stars. I'm sorry I couldn't give it more, and I don't necessarily believe that Simpson is innocent. I simply question the veracity of the story based on information given by the author himself. Ultimately, I can neither encourage nor discourage the reader.

However, if you are a parent who wants to raise a child you can be proud of, then this is a great read. It follows the authors personal experience with raising his three daughters. Unfortunately many parents today can't be bothered teaching and modeling values and positive personal characteristics to their children. Hence, the rise in children living on the edge, crime, disrespect and just plain old poor behavior. As an educator, it is refreshing to read about a dad who sets standards of behavior. You get what you expect and what you allow you teach. I would recommend this book to parents who want to mould their children to be responsible citizens.",0

It did not take me long to get on Amazon and buy the complete box set of ""Desired by the Wolf"". The only problem with the story was that it was indeed too short.

He gives the inside story about teaching English in Chile by connecting his own personal knowledge of how English teaching has been developing in Chile over the past 14 years. The results of four international tests have never been wonderful, but the inside story is that English in Chile is changing the way it teaches English. The author argues that Chile could produce its own National English test, with four skills, give that test every 3 years, and have better test data to fine tune the way English is taught in Chile. I like the way he understands that the test results need to be understood as a way to keep improving teaching.

This was my first Ava book (I know, I know...start in the middle), so I didn't know how everything started, or what was going on most of the time, but I was having so much fun that I didn't care!  And for the record, I think I knew as much as Ava much of the time. LOL  I laughed hard at the hi-jinks.  I especially loved Ava's thoughts on goblin anatomy, and pretty much her thoughts on men in general.  I am definitely going back - or forward - for more in the series.

It made a change to see a male character like that. These two characters are great on their own but together they really smoulder. They show a united front and both speak their mind.

I highly recommend Countdown for fans of the Newsflesh series.",0
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"While the teaser on the book jacket moved me to buy this book, I couldn't finish reading it. The writing is uninspired, predictable. The story seems formulaic, safe - the sad stories of several women who meet at a knitting circle. The sadness is brought out pretty well, especially initially about the main character Mary's loss. But too much of sadness going on and on works against the story, I feel, so I began to ignore the emotional meanings and look for the story.

I tried to keep at it, but I gave up halfway, which is rare for me to do. I actually skipped the stories of two of the women - you know they are coming, and you don't care about any of them so why should you be forced to read what sad things they went through? Disappointing book.",0

This volume of The Alpha Men's Secret Club continues Rust and Kate's story from the first book. The curvy woman is deep in the alpha's clutches, and things heat up as an old friend gets in between the two and makes things a proper love triangle.

Kate must wrangle with her feelings for the unreachable and powerful alpha shifter, or her classmate, who's genuinely sexy and possessive in his own ways. I loved the tension and explosive moments between all these characters. The story moves with a uniquely Dawn Steele energy and creativity that's hard to put down, even to take a well needed rest!

Great characters, great chemistry between the H/h, excellent plots and twists. You won't be disappointed. My personal beef with books in this genre, is when the heroines are redundantly stupid and frustrating throughout the story. If you can get past that, you will definitely enjoy this series.

So I decided to try again with Interference. Ms. Henry is consistent in her willingness to tackle subjects that are painful. From the beginning she delivers that one, two punch. Complex people facing their demons and working to overcome them. Jason has baggage that has followed him into adulthood. From abandonment and trust issues, to an attraction that pulls the scab off a partially healed wound. Linden has worked to become a responsible young woman. An act of rebellion in her teens left her with more responsibility than she expected and the shame of disappointment. Interference redeemed Sophia Henry in my eyes.

Some of the reviews sound like they were written by over-inflated self-important critics ... particularly when they delve into deep spiels about character development and narrative values.

But, if it was finished the author would not realize any financial gain, and would not continue.  I felt the narrative to be snappy, action-filled and the plot line surprisingly well thought-out. This is zombies in an urban environment, so the killing is massive, graphic and almost never-ending.

This is the second book I have read today this was shorter, simpler but I cried a lot of tears reading this story. I was definetly connected to this story.

Kelly was very sucessful and happy with her life.  She was manager of Magazine and engaged to the Owner. Then she got a call that her dad had died and left everything to her. Kelly had not seen her father or  heard from him since she was three.

Kelly flies into town plans to sign papers and leave that same weekend but she found out a little about her dad and somethings about herself.

Like I said its short only 130 pages but it packs a punch, Its romance with fishing and lake Winnebago. I enjoyed it except for my crying.

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,First book was good but the second so awful!!!! I stopped reading it when I got to her x boyfriend and how he treated her. It was just too much!!!ugh! I feel disappointed cause the first book was not so bad and she seemed a strong character. I had read what Wendy wants and it was cute.. That was the only reason why I gave this book set a chance. It's not right for a little girl to do grown up stuff and that right there was the last straw. Well lesson learned no more from this author..I'm not a prude but it's way too much!!!  If it had just told the story of her leaving and her life in hiding...The level of abuse was really something I can't get into and I really feel others will feel this way too.

We start out with a substitute teacher waiting with a student during an oncoming snowstorm for her ride. Enter Dante James, hot, mysterious stranger to pick up the student Seraphina.  He's not on the approved list but Seraphina knows him well.  While waiting for approval, he has his sights set on hot, older teacher, Olivia.  She has such a visceral reaction to him and she doesn't know why, seeing as he appears much younger than she.  He notices her reluctance but feels drawn to her.

In this story, the unlikely combination is a hot dog stand, a carnival, and a baseball stadium--not obvious choices for a searing hot love story, but Eden, as per usual, creates gold. The characters, settings, and situations are creative and compelling.  The characters and storyline have a depth that give the book staying power--I can't get it off my mind (a delicious ""problem"").  I originally read this book when it was titled TuDawgs; at the time, I really wished there was more than one book in this ""world.""

Quick read - alternating points of view
Let me start off by saying the story itself was ok. There were a few errors that were distracting/confusing. The reason why Robyn was kicked out at age 15. The whole family dynamics was off. There story in the beginning of the book was not what was revealed at the end. the relationship between Garrick and Robyn pretty much happened over night. Robyn was very independent and she worked hard to pay her bills and finance her degree. Garrick wanted to take care and protect her. He was possessive and bossy. They clashed a lot. But the make ups were hot and sexy.
There was a lot of drama in a short period of time. Robyn became a magnet for trouble. Near rapes, stalkerish ex, drug dealers etc. Everything wrapped up nice and neat in the end.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I would have liked to have much more interaction between Cade and Cecelia. This book is in the romance section but most of the book was about all the different ops going on in the story. And the note at the bottom of the book description about graphic sex? Maybe I'm just biased based on the other books I've read but the 3 scenes I remember (& I don't count one-liner remembering as a sex scene) were not exactly graphic in my opinion.

All that being said, this was a good military romance read, with lots of twists, turns, violence, intrigue, etc.

This is book 3 in the Deep Six Security series, so you may want to read the other two first. It is not necessary, in my opinion (I have not read them), but may help in understanding where the other characters are coming from in this story.",0

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This leaves us with one solution to our political problem: A Free State America and a Progressive Union America.  We as a people can then ""vote with our feet"" as to which side best represents our hopes and dreams.

One reviewer mentioned something about the way Cass spoke-yeah, it wasn't my favourite, but she didn't speak like that all the time and it didn't detract from the story, in fact it made me realise that there are all types of dialects and speech patterns* and it has very little to do with how or with whom one falls in love.

Oh, and they are all in serious need of some quality editing. The poor editing just made the stories even worse.

Dont ask me why I took so long to read this book because I don't have a reason.  I am in love with Ms. Burtons Hope series and I am so glad that I did finally pick up this novella!!
I really enjoyed Will & Janes journey.  Both are just great.  Even if Jane is stubborn and determined to do it all on her own.  I could tell you everything that happens but what fun would that be.  (hint it wouldnt be any fun).
If you are a Hope fan and you have not read this novella yet?  You should and I think you will enjoy it very much.  If you are new to this series you don't have to start here but I think you should.

Sadie has agreed to be his live-in chef and assistant, but she is determined not to get involved with him other than professionally. He's exactly the type she always goes for and knows she shouldn't. Sadie gets confusing sometimes. She can't make up her mind, she runs hot and cold. It is entertaining, though. And really, I can see why she's torn. He's used to women falling at his feet and she's a challenge. I really did not want to like Heath at the beginning of the book. I didn't think it was possible. He grew on me, though. By the end of the book I was rooting for him. This ended up being a fun read, with a few tears thrown in. If you like reformed bad boys, I think you'll like this one.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I was asked to review this book, and agreed. However, I found it so incredibly useful that I bought a copy so it can reside on my Kindle. Crosby and Dobbins have written a comprehensive overview that helps take your book from I've-written-a-book-now-what to a formatted and marketable product. There are few (if any?) books that address ebook marketing in such a comprehensive manner.

I found the sections on marketing the most useful. What makes this material (and all subjects in the book) so valuable is the many links to sites to help you learn more. Since I periodically use KDP Select for free days, the lists of sites to publicize free books was of special interest.

The authors operate a site called Kindle Book Promo. While it is mentioned when it relates to a topic, this book is not an advertising vehicle for the authors' services.

She is used to being busy, to working and now she is unsure of herself. So she decides to work on herself while she is waiting for the next call.and that call is from Greg.

I don't know why, but there are 2 of the Billionaires that I was most excited to read about. Tristan, the super hot partner who is the ultimate man candy for Chelsea and Greg. Greg was the one that brought her too the other partners and the first partner she was with. In this story we not only get to see Gregs kinky nature but his teasing one too. Chelseas character become even more developed and its exciting to see her grow.

She is such a charismatic person that people just generate to her warm, bubbly personality. She is the center of attention anywhere she goes. The people that know Miss Welch in person are truly lucky indeed. I'm glad to say that I'm among those lucky people.
From this hilarious novella, I've learned how to use duct tape correctly, train my houseboys (if I ever get any) and how to be a great stalker. The lessons you can learn from her are endless.

There isn't a ton of content but what is there is vivid and beautiful and the descriptions are short but apt.
This picture book is set in Italy and deals with the most famous attractions there such as
- Vatican City
- Pompeii
- Venice Canals
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa
- Amalfi Coast
- Lake Como
- Colosseum

I find that this is a good addition to my geography and social studies lessons. For any age. It isn't extremely detailed and it isn't long on pages, but it has great pictures. A great introduction to the important places in Italy.

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.

Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper.

I loved this character and her gargoyles from the first novella that I read but this book was technical with almost no heart or development for the few characters there were.  I was completely bored with the formation of crystals and what it took to form the crystals.  I felt like I was in a cave forming crystals through out most of the book.  That is what I mean by the book being too technical.  If there was such a thing as gargoyles, this would be the manual on how to make your own gargoyle. The writer spent way too much time on that and not enough time on developing the romance and bringing life to the final story in this series.

Much to admire about Sarah, though maybe not her cooking skills, which last there of only served to make her more endearing. Her true strength of character shows through as she tries her best for Harold and then Max. Speaking of which, Max is a true friend to Harold but hard to like at first.

It is the differences in the characters with the wariness that acts as a catalyst that leads to their dealing with past issues in their lives. Love and family is always worth the work as Sarah and Max discover. Of course, a little Christmas magic never hurts either. A valuable lesson to be learned. Delightful read.

After an ominous prologue in 1925 we fast-forward to the present and to a military base located on an island from where a helicopter full of people destined for a mainland vacation takes off. Meanwhile, things go very wrong and the chopper returns to the island with all its passengers plus some military brass. From this point on the copter passengers are in a fight for survival against overwhelming odds. They can't possibly win ... or can they?
The book is well-written. Although I felt it was a wee bit slow in getting underway, when it did take off it was a whirlwind! The characters: plastic (in more ways than one), credible, with some likable and others less so - as in the real world. I definitely recommend this book!",0

This book was okay the characters were young and still in high school so at times they came off as very immature. The town they lived in and the school they went to seemed a bit unrealistic, the fact that Ashley's father could go from never spanking her to as harsh as was felt unbelievable. Ashley's character really frustrated me the constant back and forth on her feelings for Jackson, and Jackson was really pushy about getting married. Throughout the book we get to watch them go through marriage classes and that's when it starts to feel like a ""how to"" book. There are only a few spanking scenes in this book and only one between Ashley and Jackson.

Regina Puckett

Reviewed by Roy Murry, Author

This Young Adult read is for the young at heart like them and me. It is fun, bizarre, and delightful. Some of the reasons I keep coming back to Regina's short novels

In this adventure, Liberty, a young lady pilot of an airship, goes about her business of bartering items needed in her post end of times world.

On one of her stops to deliver goods, she takes on the task of caring for a robot who has feelings. On a stop to get water fuel for her ship, she encounters other humans.

The adventure begins, and Liberty breaks all of her dead father's rules by engaging the robot and the humans. She finds love, a trait she has been avoiding all her life.

How this all comes about and how Liberty changes are the lessons learned in this novel; some that YA's should learn.

An enjoyable quick read. The way I like it.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I love the P&P continuance stories and there are so few compared to the ""What if's "" that I am thrilled everytime I find one. This book did not dissappoint. Romantic, passionate and thrilling read. Loved this Elizabeth and Darcy. The plot was plausible and so were their reactions.

Loved how Elizabeth coaxed Darcy by humour and other means of persuasion rather than being insulted or timid.

The story begins as they leave their wedding breakfast and the night does not end well. The next morning comes with reconciliation and their bond grows stronger until a message is sent to Darcy from his former mistress brother. Instead of confiding in Elizabeth, he tries to manage the escalating problems on his own but Elizabeth is on to him...

Really loved this book and would love a sequal to see how Georgiana and Kitty got along. Their stories are left hanging. And of course, I can never get enough of ODC...

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Being in the dentist's chair is usually an uncomfortable and anxious place to be, but this story turns it around and puts the dentist on the spot. As he pokes and prods with his instruments, he is soon distracted by his patient's new accessory. The doctor has seen plenty of tongue rings but never one quite like this. It's very odd and makes him feel as if someone is watching him. As he continues his examination, he is soon troubled and scared by what he finds.

This story is maybe a fifteen-minute read, but it doesn't short-change the reader that feeling of expectation. There is a nice feeling of suspense for the reader as we wait to see exactly what the good doctor will discover in what is supposed to be a routine exam. From the well-chosen book cover with its unnerving stare to the patient's startling and ominous revelation, it all comes together for a good and kind of creepy read.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Kammie & Luca, yes please!!! I was so excited to start this book and read about these two and Krissy V did not disappoint. This book is about Natasha & Fleix's best friends. Mr. & Mrs. no relationships. They have an instant attraction but do not want to be involved with each other because of their friends. They think it will just complicate a already complicated situation with Natasha & Felix, but their chemistry is too strong and situations too intense to break the bond they have. Instead it turns it from friends to lovers. The desire for each other becomes too much and they change their relationship! I absolutely love these two as a couple. The chemistry Krissy created between these two is amazing. You can feel it deep down. This is defiantly one of those books that just makes you happy!!!

Jenna Bennett is an outstanding writing and she proves it once again with this first book in a new series, Fidelity Investigations.
Gina Kelly thinks that realizing that her husband might have tricked her out of getting any money in their pending divorce is the worst thing that could ever happen to her; least that is was she thinks until he is murdered and she becomes the prime suspect.  Gina is not an investigator, but she has already been following her cheating spouse and that woman with great success for all the good it did.

I really enjoyed Stella's character. She was very realistic, down to her insecurities. Because we all know sometimes we aren't as confident with our bodies as we would like to be. I loved how the two guys were each their own person. They had completely different personalities which lead to different working relationships and what people thought of them. I thought that was really unique because often it seems multiple characters will start to essentially merge into one.

The love aspect between Stella and the men in this book was a little hard to believe compared to some of the other books. It felt a little rushed. But beyond that I loved it! Still absolutely worth the read!!",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"While I love an action romance story like everyone else,what I can't get is when the editing is poor that it takes away from the story. This is such a good story with a whole lot of potential,but the need for better editing takes that away. This is sexy sensual romance between two very stubborn and strong willed people. The chemistry between the two main characters is off the charts and the writer makes you believe. I love the action between these two characters,I just wish for a tad bit more story and a little more from the supporting cast. The story moves at a fast pace so that you are not bored or bogged down with unnecessary drama. The execution is excellent,you get glimpses of emotions and feelings. This was a really good solid story,one you can not regret reading. I would love to see a revised version and it be released if possible and with a not so abrupt ending.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"One Funeral continues on right where No Weddings ends. This time it's in Hannah's point of view. It takes you through Hannah's journey of getting through the pain of what her ex had done to her in the past and re-starts the build up of her relationship with Cade.
I tend to not read stories that about ongoing relationships, but something about how this story is written makes me want to hurry up and keep reading to see how it ends. I thought the authors did a tremendous job of completely creating two entirely different characters in Hannah and Cade. Having this story in Hannah's perspective, you feel her vulnerability as she moves through the story, something you don't really get in the first book as Cade doesn't really see her vulnerable side. This entire series is much like the characters' relationship, a nice slow burn that allows the relationship to build in a lasting way.

I didn't particularly like the first story, Our Song Cassie was a bit too whinny for me, but that was more personal preference than a reflection on the story. War of Hearts also felt a little contrived, but I am sure there are those that would disagree.
I did enjoy Between the Lines. The romance was so cute and I couldn't help but root for Thomas to work out his mix up. I also loved William and his concern for Claire in A Taste of Home.   Both these stories had swoon worthy endings left you rooting for happily ever afters.

Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot.",0

I think it is worth cautioning readers that are sensitive to the issue of rape that a central element of the story is a woman dealing with her feelings after such an event. The heartbreak and turmoil of such medieval pillaging is part of the nature of Saxon attacks on a rural Roman villa in England. The tale is of love and triumph but real in the brutal reality of the period.

With the death of the men of the farm, the women are left to survive and go on living. They struggle to survive from meager food stuffs while rival powers exert influence on the villa women.  The story has sad elements but Diana, the eldest surviving daughter of the land owner, captures your heart with her courage.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...
Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.
While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.

She stayed close to his twin brother Malcolm and over the last year, they spoke less and less about Marcus during their weekly phone calls.  One day Kylie received an invitation to the island of Eden and it was signed, The one who's always loved you.  Naturally, Kylie assumed it was Marcus.

I love the Invitation to Eden series.  The reader can always count on that ""feel good"" feeling at the end of the book.  Elena Aitken did not disappoint.  One thing you must remember about Eden is that the island always knows what you want and need, even if you have yet to realize it.  Kylie and Malcolm's story was very sweet and romantic.  I look forward to more from this series and this talented author.

Kindle_Store_5,4,CG,"Persuasion is book 3 of the series and the first in the series.

The first book is a short but very enjoyable read, with a bit of a twist. The second book is a bit more detailed and in a slightly different way. I would recommend this to everyone who enjoys a little adventure.

The third book, The Last Hero, is a very well written book. It is a very well written book with a strong plot and characters that will keep you interested. The story is very well written and the characters are very well developed. I would highly recommend this book to everyone who enjoys adventure stories.

Brock doesn't disappoint! If you ever feel like a story lacks description and detail then you need to read Impulses.

Samantha and Hayden are both shattered souls that wind up together. Their journey to get there is long, sad, and wonderful. Sam is beginning what she thinks is another temp but when she meets her boss, she cannot ignore the feelings that stir.

Hayden feels it too but his past haunts him and he's not sure if he can relive that. One steamy time together and they are hooked to each other. Forever bound.

While the journey isn't easy it's worth the wait. Impulses shows you what can happen when you just dive in and see where the road takes you. I am very impressed and will definitely add more of Brock to my collection.",0

This is the story of Lindsay and Ty.
Lindsay is a veterinarian, a job she loves.
Ty is a rancher, a job he loves.
They had met at college but they weren't an item.
Years later, he runs into Lindsay again. The chemistry is still there, and Ty is determined to not let Lindsay get away again.
Things happen with Lindsay that makes her pull away from Ty. She ends all contact with him.
After not seeing her for 14 months, Ty runs into her once again at a conference. Lindsay holds a secret, one that she is not sure Ty will forgive her for. After he finds out, he wants nothing more than to be with the woman he loves...Can Lindsay trust in Ty? Can Ty convince her he is the one to trust, to be vulnerable with?

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"I read about a chapter of this book. The writing is irritating, being 99% heroine's inner dialogue, with tiny phrases of conversation every page or so. The action freezes solid while we examine the heroine's inner thoughts, her past, her toenail polish ...

Forcing myself onward, I discovered this chick is truly too stupid to be out on her own. She let her former boyfriend walk all over her, steal her blind and humiliate her on national tv. This doesn't fit what I've heard of successful ballerinas, who have to be intelligent and tough as steel to make it to the top of their profession. It also does not give me a heroine I can relate to. Now she's chasing after a cage fighter ... and is so TSTL she leaves her expensive coat with cell phone and wallet in a cheap dive bar while she pirouettes off to chase the hero.

I suggest the hero run the other way as fast as his muscular legs can carry him.",0

The heroine was a bit of a golem with a bad attitude and in the end she was a bit of a loner.  The book had a bit of a romance going on between the two characters and it was a little predictable.  I just didn't care for the heroine's actions.  I don't think I will read more about her in future books.

Overall, I loved this story.  I just didn't get it.  It was a bit slow paced, but it kept my interest.  I'll be looking for more by this author.I love this series, and this story is awesome. It's a great story about a strong woman who is",1

Although I've not read the books before this one in the series, I think the author did a great job, I wasn't totally lost, but I definitely need to read the others.

Tina and Irish were great together. They were an unlikely couple but made it work. Tina had fled her abusive ex and landed in the arms of a sexy biker. Irish was everything her ex wasn't. Oh my gosh, the man is so loveable and sexy!!  He quickly is in her life and tries to get her to lower that wall that she's built up around her heart. Can she lower that wall or will she keep her heart guarded?

Because this is a novella, I feel like there's a lot more to Irish and Tina's story and it's a shame this story ended just as I was getting into it!  Overall, a great book!

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I loved the story of Sam and Chloe (or Same and Chloe if one of the typos wasn't a typo). It was a story of a long lasting love that just needed the right timing. Sam finally gets tired of waiting and hauls his lady back home to Texas where they build on  their relationship. The story was great and fairly well done. The supporting characters were a nice touch. Typos still abound with words that are poorly chosen (always spelled correctly but the wrong word in the sentence) and things that don't make sense. The winner for this novel - a car that becomes a truck then goes back to being a car, like the transformers children play with but in this case I think the author forgot what kind of vehicle she had Sam driving. As usual, I liked this enough to suggest others make the purchase. My less than perfect rating is still due to the fact that a proofreader is truly needed. Enjoy.",0

I liked the story without knowing more details on who the old man was or what his life was before. I took everything at face value in the story, and I enjoyed the read.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Oh, unf. I have loved every word of The London Lovers. Silas and Molly were such a fantastic match and they flew off the page with Sierra Simone's talented and passionate mind.
Molly overcame so much and Silas' devotion is swoon worthy. Fortunately, he likes to take your breath away in other, more exciting, ways.
Silas is a package and a half. He keeps Molly (and us) on edge with his dirty talk and his tenderness. It's an enigma and I love hearing all the sexy details coming out of his mouth.
This conclusion provides resolution for Molly. Her character was so very strong and determined and justice was served through the help of her devoted friends and Silas. She is a champion and you can't help but wonder how many ""Mollys"" were broken because of the situation they were born into.

Simon and Jessica's training dominates the first three issues and these are interesting bits. It's great to see them interact with the rest of the Green Lantern Universe and the characters who are traditionally associated with the Green Lanterns.

Volthoom's story continues in the background in the first two issues and then comes to the foreground in penultimate issue. This is an epic story that goes back to the founding of the Lanterns. Writer Sam Humphries has done a great job slowly teasing this out and there are some key revelations in this issue that set up Humphries' final collection.

The art is great as well. I particularly appreciate the versatility of the artist as they are not only able to beautifully render known characters but also species we haven't seen before.

While Phoebe is the source of all things bountiful, her purchase of the new house and the ease at which the gang made their move seemed forced. Sure, they had to get the heck out of Dodge, but establishing roots somewhere with no real investigation of the new location seemed odd. Three stars does not mean ""bad"" it just means it was an okay read.

Like Kaiden, I was completely immersed in Serena and Elodie's world. The writing style is so compelling, and the pace of the story is perfect. The progression of the sexual tension is also incredibly exciting, even when it's one sided. That is an astounding accomplishment on its own. The author created amazing chemistry between Kaiden and Serena right from the beginning. I realize now that part of that was due to what a unique character Serena was and how fascinated he was by her.

Unfortunately, Serena later loses her uniqueness and becomes a regular girl in love. Considering the physical prowess she displayed in the first part of the story, I was expecting her to become an amazing athlete or to do something extraordinary.

I'm glad that Paige grew up strong and was able to finally make her life away from her family, and have a little independence that she sorely needed. When Paige loses her job she pulls herself up and takes charge of her life and becomes her own boss.

A big move, but one she's ready for.

You'll really enjoy how both Paige and Jake grow. Because Jake is Paige's brother Matt's friend he is taboo to her, and vice versa. But somethings the heart wants what the heart wants.

Coincidentally? Stephen King's--The Stand--worked in an almost identical fashion with the first exposed dying within minutes and those secondarily exposed later taking a couple of days and then several days to die, while those who were immune were just immune.

I realize that no novel can tell everything, but there are a crucial two months missing, where a plague apparently swept the Earth and the ""Immari Imperium"" began. Finally, and for me the most vexing thing, is the fact that there are aliens beneath the Antarctic and we don't know a thing about them except that they built a device that transmits a virulent plague.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Combing the mythological stories of the Argonauts, with futuristic genetic manipulation, Kneupper has crafted an exciting sci-fi tale that reimagines an old story in a fantastic new way.
 Following the adventures of Jason, a super-soldier and product of the genetic code enhancements provided by Argo Corp, and genomancer Medea, Argonauts is faced paced, without skimping on immersive world building or short changing the plot.
 Argonauts is well-written clear, clean prose, strong characterization, and page turning action sequences. It is sure to be a welcome addition to the reading shelf of fans of Sci-fi, and bio-genetics in particular.
 My only criticism of this book is that I would have liked to see Medeas personality be a bit stronger. Im assuming shell have a growth arc later on, as it set up well for her to snap out of her lovesick behavior pattern. Her personality made the book read more like a YA to me, which may or may not have been his intention. Either way, could completely be a set up for future installments.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"A little deeper than most. In addition to the plot, it examines the aftermath of extreme emotional cruelty (as well as physical abuse) to a wife at the hands of her husband; the doubts and insecurities of a hero who therefore seems more genuine than the usual ""tall, dark, and brooding""; and an old lady in the throes of dementia, possibly Alzheimer's. This book tends toward the inner life of the characters over the action, but the various relationships feel genuine. There is a mystery that could have had more detailed development for my taste, but there was a sufficiently evil villain, a thrilling confrontation and a resolution. I found this book because I was laughing at the various offerings of sex scenes wrapped in imitation stories and was sure this would be one of those, based on the bare chested man on the cover.

Aaron's relationship with Zach's brother and wife need to be discussed. There is so much co dependency in Aaron.

I'll admit as I was reading the book, I at first thought he spent too much time in the characters and I wanted him to ""pull back out"" to show the people playing the game; but in hindsight, he balanced it just right.

The characters were all well-developed.

The puzzles in Doodle Fit use ""fixed"" polyominoes, which cannot be rotated.  This helps the enjoyability of these puzzles, since logic will often force a few of the pieces, and then the rest can be placed.

In each puzzle, a goal is given, and pieces that can make the goal.  The 5-way is used to place each piece.  Some semi-crazy black and white pattern shading is used on each piece.

There are 27 shapes in the beginners pack.  I got the first 17 very quickly, then had to think for awhile on #18. The higher level packs are locked until you solve earlier packs.

Apocalypse Evolution was a good story.  Its definitely science fiction with a nice apocalyptic touch.  There were a few unbelievable parts, but in science fiction, you can have totally out there things that could/would happen in certain circumstances.

Bryces writing was tight and to the point.  There wasn't too much wasted time in this short story.  The comes at a slight fault, though, we really don't know much about Eve and her backstory other than that she is basically on borrowed time and being hunted.

I LOVED him. For me, that was what made me keep turning the page. Plus there wasn't a lot of ""fluff"" (you know, the parts that you skip over cuz you just want to get back to the plot of the story).

The books in the series all take place in Marietta and the pending celebrity wedding of a local girl gone big time links them together. The neat fact is that the books in this series are written by different authors. I enjoyed Magdalena and Jake's story. We saw them both in previous books and we knew that Magdalena had returned home with her teenage daughter after being gone since she became pregnant as a teenager. She has been the topic of small town gossip because she has never revealed the name of her daughter's father. Jake is a famous country singer who is taking a break because he's lost his muse and is unable to write any new music. Although famous, Jake is down to earth and likable. Im not always a fan of love at first sight, but Jakes feelings for Magdalena are sincere and based upon not only her looks but her singing. This was a good book and a nice addition to the series.

What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing?

Kindle_Store_5,1,OR,"I couldn't finish. It was painfully one-dimensional to me: the reader was told how to feel about every character and situation from the beginning (I tried to let it slide, because beginnings can be rocky even with great stories).
Fav part was when the Hero was talking to an evil henchman, and he yells, ""How much are they paying you?"" And the henchman replies some amount that means nothing to me, and the Hero says, ""It's not enough,"" and flies into a confident, low-stakes martial-arts butt-kicking, somehow never revealing his face. It might actually be cooler and more believable the way I described it. So cheesy!
Then I got bored: erotic dreams of characters who have no emotional attachment to each other doesn't interest me at all, especially because I'm not attached to either of these characters. I was rolling my eyes about their lusty waking inner-monologues, too. And then our Hero was thinking about masturbating on and off for three pages and there's no chance of this ever feeling romantic to me.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Out of Frame is the third In Focus book that I've read and I really liked it!  The story is told in first person from the perspective of both main characters, Jay and Quinn. I always enjoy first person, and while this is a great way to get into the heads of both guys without resorting to third person, sometimes I found it a little confusing. Okay, I admit it, I'm not a young man anymore and maybe my short term memory isn't what it used to be.....  :) Erickson began each chapter with the name of the character telling it, so I guess the confusion wasn't the author's fault.

Anyway, I often like romance stories where opposites are attracted to each other. Jay and Quinn are very different but alike in many ways too. The plot contains a fair share of tension but I likes how the guys dealt with it.

Out of Frame was proofed well, and the Kindle formatting was very good on my iPad. This book is definitely on my 'recommend' list for those who like this genre!",0

The addition of the rival wolf and the extremes he goes to to keep Yeager and Cassie apart gave the book a lot of tension.  AndI won't reveal any spoilersbut the ending is a whole nother twist that I didn't expect.

He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.

I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances.

The story is well written, the characters are very relatable and easy to like. But my issue with the story is how so many characters have special powers or abilities for one reason or another. Yet, there's no explanation as to why. It's just - here are 5 people and they're all enhanced for some reason.... that will miraculously work to their advantage in the end. I love paranormal stories, but there has to be some reason or explaination or secret government testing or ANYTHING for that matter to explain why there are so many people with abilities.

Other than that, the story is well written to show how Jade is struggling to overcome her limitations because she's an empath. She's a very likable character and the author does a nice job of making you want to root for Jade you succeed.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Mia has had a crush on her brother Blake's best friend Drew for years. About a year ago, Drew betrayed Blake and there were devastating consequences. When Drew finally returns to school, he's scared and not the same boy he was before. He has no friends and no confidence. Mia still sees the same boy she has crushed on for years and when they are assigned to the same class project and have to spend time together, they rekindle a friendship. They shouldn't be together but they can't fight the feelings they have for each other.

I enjoyed this book but it was a lot more depressing and sad than I was expecting. My feelings were kind of torn on Drew at first but my heart just broke for him. I can't imagine having to live with the kind of guilt that he carried. Mia was a good heroine, she had a good heart and was very sweet. There were a few small things that bothered me about this story but overall I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more by this author.",0

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"One word sums up the follow up to The School for Mysteries: A Cozy Paranormal Adventure (Nurse Phoebe Book 2) and that is ""disappointment"". The predecessor was such a fun and exciting read in which the middle aged protagonist goes on a very wild adventure full of page turning thrills such as a heart stopping pursuit by unknown enemies, a murder attempt, etc. Even though that book's ending felt a little abrupt, I was still eagerly anticipating the next book in the series. If the last book fell short in the ending, this follow up more than compensates by having too much filler on the history and descriptions of French castles and its prior inhabitants. It felt as though Ms. Jourdan was promoting French tourism instead of focusing on her characters. The book did not actually pick up pace until the half way mark and even then her nemesis was hardly developed as a character. I absolutely love Phoebe's character and hope that if Ms. Jourdan continues the series that she brings back the exciting energy of the previous book because this one fell flat.",0

Kat is a college student who is working at the college library and is dared to kiss the first hot guy she sees, which happens to be Gavriel. This dare leads to her following him home and witnessing something no one was ever meant to witness. Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.

The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV. The chemistry between the characters was hot and the sex scenes hotter. This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.

Overall, a recommended read.",0

Naturally I take interest in anything that would affect his health, so I decided to read the book myself. The book provides comprehensive, easy to read information on the 10 most beneficial supplements for men and how they can help to get that sexy physique that you desire. What I like most about the book is that it gives a complete overview of the supplements their benefit, uses and precautions. Reading this book will help any man on the quest for a safe and healthy way to build lean muscles by complementing their diet with supplements to achieve their goals. The author goes as far as to telling you which workout programs goes best with the supplements, for example creatine is good for short repetitive workouts as opposed to aerobics. Well written facts on supplements that I know will benefit anyone who wants to increase their knowledge as well as use supplements in a safe and effective way.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"3.5 torn stars, rounded up. I liked the story, but it was a cliffhanger, which I really don't like at all. When I invest hours of precious time in a story, get into it, and then discover I have to buy the next ""x"" number of books to find out what happens and get some closure, I'm not happy.

Besides that, I did like the story. I'm a big fan of paranormal romance, and this one was different enough from the usual to be fresh and interesting. After a slow start detailing the travels of the heroine, things really picked up when she finally found what she'd been looking for all along - a vampire. The characters were likable enough, though some plot lines seemed a little forced. Paranormal secondary characters were enjoyable, but I found the heroine's best friend to be pushy and kind of obnoxious.

I'm not sure if I'll grab the next one, knowing I'm setting myself up for another cliffhanger (did I mention I really don't like cliffhangers?). It will depend on if the story sticks with me in the next couple of weeks.",0

The story was well written to the point I cried at times.  I could feel the pain and angst the main character, Ana, was going through.  Ana doesnt reveal what happened in her past right away but there were enough hints that I was heartbroken for her.

I was rooting for Ana through the whole book and it was a complete rollercoaster for her (as well as for me!!).

I don't want to give anything away as to what happened with Ana but there is a huge cliffhanger at the end of the book. It was one of those that sucked the air out of my lungs because I couldn't believe what just happened.  It was one of those endings that I had to sit back and give myself some time to digest and figure out what I will read next.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"FRANK ALTOBELLI'S ""TRUE HEART"" (REVIEW)

This book was wonderful! It had the perfect amount of fantasy and adventure along with a love story that was sweet and unexpected. Mouse, the heroine of the novel is almost sprite-like in her mannerisms and you can tell she has a heart of gold. When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

The entire world is built in such a manner that you can easily follow the multiple different aspects of this well written novel.  Unfortunately I had a hard time fully getting into the story.

I enjoyed the characters in this novel.  Leigh has developed them in a multifaceted manner, allowing readers to get to know them on many levels.  There were times when I had a bit of difficulty merging them with their counterparts in the first novel of the series.  The major transformations and character shifts were a little drastic, but were also very well & easily explained by the current events surrounding the characters.

Sunset Hill opens with our killer picking up a newly divorced man at a local bar as she gives the reader a peak into her strategy for choosing her targets.  Between the murder mystery aspect of the book and the social interactions that occur between Grant and the other main characters the plot moves quickly and with great interest.

Having not read the other books in the Grant Starr series did not seem to detract from my understanding of the plot and enjoyment of the book.

And the moments where you've been given a chance to let your heart slow down don't ever last too long before you're thrown back into the action again.

Leah is a girl who loses everything when an energy blast rips through her town. Now taken in by a band of folks called Pyros, she comes to find out the truth about who she is and what she can do, as well as whom to trust and whom not to.

There is a lot of mythological weaving in this story, which I quite enjoyed. Adams does a nice job of simultaneously answering questions that pop up during Leah's journey and adding new questions as a result of those answers.

It goes well beyond a menage scenario as they continue to explore other fantasies. Chase and Zoe are completely uninhibited but the relationships begin to strain after a while.

It's well written and the complexity of the characters make it interesting beyond the sexual exploits. This is as sexually explicit a story as I've ever read so take that as a warning if that makes you uncomfortable.

I can, without pause, give a STRONG recommendation to everyone who has a dream as I did, to write a book, read this first.  You'll be off on the right foot.

Thanks, Steve, for sharing your insights.  :)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Piano-Its-Purchase-and-Care/dp/B00AOSFJY0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Piano - Its Purchase and Care</a>",0

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Warning- some spoilers inside:
Not sure what to say about this book- except that I definitely liked the first book in this series better.
Here is my summary of what happened. Every chapter- Amilia falls apart and has an emotional breakdown. (Some authors don't realize that carrying a sword and killing people doesn't make a woman strong). Amilia is lacking the emotional strength that is required to be a real K-A female fantasy protagonist- sorry.
And the plot line- every few chapters we find out the ""real secret badness"" that has been going on- and every time it gets revealed more it changes again! This is confusing for the reader and feels poorly planned. And Grayson also- every chapter he is revealed to be something else and something more important that he was before. One reveal would have been enough. Again- felt forced and confusing.
The book did have some good points. I did make it through to the end and Amilia did gain some independence and strength by the last few scenes. Grayson's love for her is also a highlight of the book.
I'm just not sure whether or not I will read book three.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Even after thinking on it a while after I finished reading, I still have mixed feelings about this book.  The characters were likable, especially Cade, but there were parts of the story that just didn't work for me.  The main thing was some of the dialogue between Cade and Brook.  I hate to say it, but it was juvenile at times, and very repetitive.

As I said, I liked Cade.  I really felt bad for him, and the way he seemed to be led on my Brook, and just waiting around for her to make a decision that would effect their possible future together.  I did start liking the book more at the end, and was rooting for Cade and Brook to finally get their HEA.

The book was long, and not being completely invested in the story until close to the end, it took me longer than usual to read, so to get to the end and see that there would be another book?  I was pretty disappointed.  I still can't decide if I liked the story enough to want to see what happens next.",0

Hank Dalton received an ultimatum... Get married to inherit part of the family ranch... Or get left with nothing. Hank, the oldest, loved to run the ranch, but living two hours from civilization limits his choice of women. When his four brothers left for the city to pick up some girls, he chose to stay home... and got to rescue a stranded motorist... Charlotte Halton. Charlie was almost killed when her crazy BF drugged her and burned her apartment down, leaving her scarred both inside and out. She decided for a fresh start... and getting stranded in Paradise Valley in the middle of cattle country wasn't part of her plan... but it just may be Hank's luck.

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Desire: The Dining Club: Part One is the first short story in an eight part series. Since this is a short story, this review will be brief.

I don't really have much to say about it. The writing isn't awful, but it grows a bit redundant, vocabulary-wise (for example, David says a lot of things quietly).

My main issue is as follows: nothing happens in this first book. It feels like someone took the first chapter of a novel and released it independently. This first part only discusses what the club is, and that Grace is to visit. You don't really learn about the characters much and they come off as cold.

This novella gets two stars based on the concept. I'd very much like to see how this goes. However, I'm not going to collect pieces of eight like it's some kind of literary trading card. I'd rather just wait until they're all out and read them as one full length book than sit through snippets like this. I'd very much recommend that other readers do the same.

What I do know is that I thoroughly enjoyed following the story of Raine, Jem and Leif. While there are a few lighthearted, even romantic aspects, there also many dark, heartbreaking moments and more than a few surprises. While I am by nature a voracious reader, I will admit to the habit of skipping sections of books when the story drags even a little. I did not skip sections in this book, and while a few other readers commented on a slow beginning, personally I did not find that to be the case. Clearly the story ends on a note meant to set the reader up for the next book in the series. This can be tricky because the author needs to leave the reader feeling satisfied with where they've ended this part of the story, and yet wanting more. The author has accomplished that with this book, and I can honestly say I look forward to learning what the future holds for Raine. Happy to recommend Kindreds: An Alliance of Bloods.",0

Angst-check
Hot men-check
Steamy sex-check

All of the above nicely rounds out the story of Eric and Jordan, two football players looking to finally stop playing games when it comes to love.

Eric is a hot shot quarterback that is use to getting what he wants. Jordan is the up and comer, who knows all about Eric Higgins, including his sexual preference. When these two are finally in a room together, there are nothing but fireworks. Super sexy fireworks between them.

I loved how forceful Eric came off at first, with Jordan giving back as much as he was taking. Even the banter between these two was scorching hot. Both men are on the down low while their careers are in the spotlight, however they still want to take a chance on each other.

Playing Hard was a quick sexy read that left me wanting much, much more. As I read, I knew things couldn't be this easy for two high profile football players looking to stay in the closet, and I was right. J.T. Fox gives us an excellent first book to the Hot for Him series.

""I've loved you since the first moment you kissed me to shut me up. Nasty tactic, as I can't object when I've got a mouthful of your tongue. There has only ever been you since that moment. And there will only ever be you, Simon Bryan. You are mine, only mine, and if anyone ever looks at you again, I will string them up by the balls and kill them, slowly and painfully."" Luke to Simon

""I've loved you since the first moment I say you. Little did I realise what a possessive pain in the ass you were going to be. If I'd known... I'd still be here now, even if you are a high maintenance (insert an amazon declared naughty word here)."" He brushed his thumb over Luke's cheek, laughing softly at Luke's look of outrage. ""I will always love you. You fill my head and my heart. There will never be anyone else in my life, Luke Murray. Just you."" Simon to Luke.

It takes a long time for a man to come to terms with his feelings for Bethany. And with a man who has a secret crush on her, Bethany has no idea he is doing anything to make her feel happy. But when the man meets her, she will have to come to terms with what is happening.

The first thing you will notice is the way this book makes you feel. The scenes are real, but the sex scenes are not. Instead, Bethany is thrust into a situation where the man is not willing to give up and she feels no need to be forced to give up.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Argh, this book is very frustrating. It's sort of like reading a stream of consciousness with, lots of quick random changes of topic. Sort of like giving a character an accent it's sorta interesting, but it got old quickly.

It's also a thriller, and it uses a bunch of cheap tricks to achieve that. Every other page is some new dangerous life or death situation. Despite all the talk of how competent the characters are they are still thrown from one random situation to another, really they are just along for the ride their choices don't seem to matter, the author will dues ex machina as needed to keep people alive and to keep the suspense and urgency going. Also he's really light on the backstory, constantly hinting at it with characters literally saying ""ill explain everything later"" but they never do.

Frustratingly I think the setting of the book is fairly interesting, sort of a shadow run setting, except more post apocalyptic and heavier on the brain hacking/AI side. Unfortunately it being the sort of thriller it is , it doesn't really build a coherent world, you're just left with a bunch of impressions with no predictive power.",0

She thought she could never have her mate but things soon change for Mags and Clay. I loved this couple and seeing their relationship take shape made for a nice read. The two are great together.

Since the name of the character and the writer are the same, at first I thought it was the authors introduction, but it seemed like the story, so I read on. And it's a good thing too, because it was the actual story.

Then after page after page of intro, finally came the interview. But before the interview could get started, there was yet more of the unnecessary yakking, where our interviewee sat at the table texting her heart out while Miss Fang ranted and raved about how attractive this vampire was.

Now the story finally gets started, and it was exactly what I had expected, but it was quick. Of course, we know by this point, the relationship will not advance, so it was no hardship when you never find out what happens next, the interview is simply over.

setting: contemporary
format: collection of short stories

The author's book description is so far off as to be false advertising. This is NOT a novel. This is a collection of short stories. I only read the first. If the author doesn't take the time to describe the ""freebie"" stories, I conclude the quality is too low to be worth my time. The first story supports this.

""Bearly Mended"" shows potential. He & she meet when she (a doctor) treats his wounds. What I liked best is the universe, which shows potential. The leading man's personality & behavior was well crafted. The grammar was pretty good, which is above most self published stories.

Alas, the problems are numerous. The plot is fragmented. The doctor's behavior is so unprofessional (what employer would put up with an employee just leaving mid-shift without notice?) and unrealistic (how did this doctor get avoid working in an emergency room as part of her training?) that she would be fired immediately. The lack of police involvement cannot be justified in a society where shifters are known citizens. The transition between chapters can be rough, sometimes feeling like the author accidentally erased a few chapters.

I also hated how she would say ""my half brother"" all the time, I get that we need to know that, but if we are to believe she loves and cares for her brother Darius and they are close, by the author always using half brother instead of brother its not believable, they ARE blood, it shouldn't matter that they have different fathers.
I really liked Micah! I didn't think his secrets were all that bad. Although he has money, he is very giving to those he cares about and he gives a lot to charity. For me Micah made the book!
Another big problem for me was, that Allie and Micah NEVER said I LOVE YOU!!! Only at the very end, did Micah say ""this is love"" and all Allie did was smile and nod!! I've never read a book before where the main characters didn't say ""I love you"" at some point in the book. I found this to be very odd!!

As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.

This started out as a slightly depressing story- Atwood's wife cheats on him, his in-laws (mother/father/brother) live with them and take complete advantage of him, his job's in jeopardy. The best thing his wife could have done for him was get him hooked up with the All American Studs crew, where he's finally able to realize what makes him happy.

Trailer Park Abe is a quick read, but there's a lot packed into this short story...I was disgusted by his wife and her family, frustrated with the way they treated him and how he let himself be treated, but glad when he decided enough was enough.

Working for AAS made him open his eyes to who he really is, and that made all the difference for him. Meeting Reece was probably the best thing that could have happened to him, and I am looking forward to more of their story.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed Dead Running very much. It had a great combination of action, romance, and witty dialogue.  There definitely were some obvious plot twists and turns but that just added to the book's charm- it was a fluffier suspense book with plenty of fun occurrences and tame romance to really engage the reader. I liked all the characters too which was a plus.

A couple of things for me that kept it from being a five star:  the ending did not have full closure, so I am assuming that there will have to be a follow-up book(s), otherwise everything is left to the imagination. That was a bummer. Second while the book was fun and I liked all the characters, Cassie was sometimes very immature. Her actions made me cring a few times.  It also annoyed me that for a person with a degree in the fitness and health industry, she did not really know her craft.

But to me, that wasn't a spoiling of the enjoyment of reading the story, cause there were many points I deeply appreciated, two out of them, the love story and the setting.

The setting was faboulos, and considering I love that Gilded Age atmosphere, and I usually try to visit at least one of those villas each time I'm in the US, I was fascinated like Griff by the architecture, and I believe the description of the lives of who was lucky enough to grew up among those walls was spot on. And the there was Pierce, so handsome and aloof, but only at first glance, cause he is the one initiating the spark between Griff and him, and once fire took place, it's hot. The sex scenes, when happening, were at the same time erotic but classy, perfectly in character with the protagonists, and again, the setting.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has been her devoted ally for years and is determined to help her heal.  While I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit hard for me to get into.  I realize all the reasons for how the book is laid out considering the ending... but it seemed to be drawn out and sometimes slow. The ending was a cliff hanger and ended rather unexpectedly.  Still Ms. Bailes is a fine author.  Her story flows, there are no spelling or grammar errors which makes the story easy to follow.  It seemed to take awhile to really get to the heart of the book but once I did, I found myself eagerly following along, cheering for Ali and Blake.  Give Shattered and Shaken a chance.  I'll be looking to add the next parts of this series to my collection.",0

The first book in the series follows the story of a woman and her dog, who are both in love with each other.  It takes place in a small town.  This is a very short story, but it is a very good one.  I can't wait to see what happens next.

This book is about a young woman who is on a mission with a group of people to help her to find her way back to her family.  She is forced to leave her small town to become a veterinarian and her dog is a complete failure.  Her dog is one of the best I've ever seen and she is a wonderful person.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Wow! I have to admit this book took me by surprise. I have had a book hangover for a few days since reading it. It's kinda like I'm obsessed by it. It was easy to read and flowed easily. But, the subject matter was a little hard at times, and a little spicy too. I found myself wanting to yell at the hero  and heroine. I guess if you do that, then it's a very compelling book. I felt like I was there along side them every step of the way in their journey.  I went ahead and read the second book because this one left me hanging. I just had to see what happened next in Katie and Keith's lives.(because I feel like family now) I'm very glad I did because it made me appreciate what they went through and how redemption is such a gift of God.
I will be reading the third one as well. This book is the first I've read from her and I really did enjoy it. I don't recommend this book for younger girls. I think I would recommend it to girls going into college as a really good example of what NOT to do.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Enthralling doesn't even begin to cover this book. Ms. Kelly's story-telling and writing style in this book was more than I could have hoped for. The story was exciting, hot, and hilarious. The plot had me staying up into the night to read longer than I should have. The female characters are strong and take no-nonsense from the alpha males in their lives. The snarky, sassy personalities had me laughing and at times cringing at their crazy, yet courageous acts. Willow is incredibly strong and doesn't hold back. This makes for, at times, a hilariously volatile interaction with Mal. Mal is your alpha male with an overprotective personality. Oh yeah they are complete opposites! I'm not sure which characters I loved more though. The secondary characters were almost as involved as the main characters and had me falling in love with them and solidifying my new addiction to this series. I'm now impatiently waiting for Book 2 and my next love match. Nothing better than a promise of more of my new loves being the center of their own books. If you haven't read this book you need to!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"First read from Emma Hart and it will not be my last. This book was just the pick me up I need after reading a lot of MC books. Mia and her friends were downright hilarious and the running commentary that Mia kept having in her head had me laughing out loud. West and his filthy delicious mouth was the type of alpha male that every woman dreams of. He let's you know what he wants when he wants it and is very confident in his abilities (with good reason).  Mia didn't think for one second that a casual hook-up with West would result into anything but the pleasure that he gave her. West was thinking the same but come to find out neither one could get the other off of their mind. When Mia finds out that she is now working for him she decides that it will be just business, too bad her heart, mind and panties didn't get the memo. When two people who can't keep their hands or mouth off the other and have gave up on relationships do is anyone's guess but if you'll like to see what happens PICK UP THIS BOOK you won't regret it.",0

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil.
Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together.
I think this could be a really great book I just think it needs a little polishing",0

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it. I don't know maybe it's just me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I hope the next book is better.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"You loved me at my Ugliest is the 3rd and final book in Evie Harper's ""You Loved me Series"". All three books can be read as a standalone but are best read in order.

This book is Joey and Alexa's story. The story begins with a lot of background information about both Joey and Alexa when they were children and flips back and forth from past to present. Alexa grew up next door to Joey and was witness to the horrific childhood abuse he endured. As a result they became friends and lovers as their relationship grew. I loved Alexa's character; she is strong, beautiful, brave and totally devoted to Joey. Joey was also amazing and truly loves Alexa but needs to find his own inner peace in order to feel he is worthy of Alexa.

I have always liked the Daisy McDare books and the way she solves the crimes. They are well written, light mysteries that are fun to read. Unlike some other reviewers, this wasn't my favourite.

Although that man can rock the heels so much better than I.

Oliver, has scars - both on the outside and inside. That man wound his way into my heart, and I am so grateful that he did.

While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people.",0

She also didn't expect to have to hide a budding relationship with her mentor from everybody around her.

I have to be very honest, when I first started reading this book, I was trying to figure out why there was a need for sequels. Then it all hit at once and I fell into the story without another thought. It may have a very slow start, but the buildup behind it is amazing!

The narrator was as amazing in this as she was the first book. I really adored her. I'd love to listen to more books by this narrator. The story was good itself, but she enhanced it even more and brought life to all of the characters.

I do recommend this book very strongly. However, I recommend that the reader read the first book before picking this book up. Many references are made to the first book that may cause a reader who didn't read it to be very confused and not as interested in the story as they would be if they read the first.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"My oh my oh my. Blue Saffire has done it again. Hmmm, love the alpha males that she brings to life. I think I just found my new boyfriend Wyatt! LOL, but seriously. I love the way she connects the characters of her books.

Wyatt is the oldest son of Joe and Cassidy Black. He has been deemed the heartbreaker, by many and he hates that title. Wyatt is looking for something special he just doesn't know what that special is until he see Nellie. Nellie has come back home to California, but she is also running away from the trouble she left back in Seattle. The trouble is not of her making, but of the crazy ex-boyfriend who didn't know much about Nellie as he thought that she did. When Wyatt first lays eyes on Nellie, he wants to lay not just eyes, but hands, mouth and body. Can Wyatt overcome his ""Heartbreaker"" stigma and win Nellie mind, body and soul? or will this heartbreaker become one of the broken hearted?

This book had me laughing, crying and wanting a Wyatt. I would recommend this book to anyone who love a good alpha male with a heart of gold story. Can't wait to read more of the Brothers Black.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Love Belvin has quickly earned a spot on my list of favorite authors. I can safely say I will read whatever she put out.

I think I might have been frustrated by the series if I read it as it was released, because each of the first books stopped very abruptly. Luckily, I didn't get put onto these books until all four were released.

I also must applaud the author of providing quality length novels. These were no novellas.

As for the actual content and presentation. Literally the only odd thing was the use of random thesaurus words that don't show up with frequency in the English language. I could guess their meanings from context clues, but I did find myself looking up a few definitions in each book.

The characterization of the main and support characters, and the development of the plot was flawless! The character's had enough of a history for them to be real, and they went through the right amount of hardships in moving toward commitment. She beautifully crafted an alpha warrior, while also allowing him to have a certain level of love and adoration of his woman. The way the characters grew to know themselves was wonderful to watch and resonated with the reader.

Well worth the read.",0

So glad you decided to release them close together. As much as I loved the first book, I can tell you without a doubt that I enjoyed this one so much more. Let me list the ways. 1. I received the answers to all of my unanswered questions in the first novel. 2. The player was finally tamed, and holy crap it was awesome. Once again the sex was smokin' hot. And not only that, we also got to see Xander's sweet and vulnerable sides. Love it!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I've read a few of the short stories based in the near future where our online lives are run by autos, smart apps designed to make our lives easier. The author creates a plausible and sinister vision of the future which I'd enjoyed. Now all of the stories have been combined into a single book, along with some new stories so I was eager to read through them.

I'll admit that I was tempted to skip through the stories that I'd read previously, but I'm glad that I didn't. The short stories provided different snap shots of the world the author has created and while they were excellwent reads in their own right, they are so much better when re-read with the wider context this book provides.

The overall story is great, the different glimpses tantilise with what is going on before drawing together into a conclusion that both feels logical and satisfies. It's also open to allow further books in the series which I hope is the intent.

As well as providing a good story the author writes well, although in many ways this is a bleak world that he creates it is still full of life and humour. Overall this is a great read that I'm happy to recommend to anyone.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to keep the reader glued to all its twists and turns.

Jennifer, the narrator of the first three books, alternates with Sabrina, the teen-age rising star of the dog show world. This is partly because of Sabrina's  closeness in age to the teens and sub-teens showing their dogs in Junior Showmanship competition and also because there is just too much happening for Jennifer to narrate it all believably. Characters, human and canine, from the previous books develop their personalities and the backgrounds continue to be so clearly described that you feel you could walk into them.

The denouement follows smoothly from what has gone before. I have only one criticism of the ending and that relates to the dog show suspense, not the mystery. There is a plot thread left dangling and I, at least, want to know what happened.

I look forward to the next book to satisfy my curiosity as well as provide a good read.",0

Waking Up

by Kirsten Clare

I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.

Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.

The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.

This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.

I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.

Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked.

Lorelei was stuck in a self imposed rut raising her daughter and Jack was in a self imposed denial because of what his mom did to him.

This is her first real assignment for Nemesis, after helping them previously. She will be posing as a maid which is easy for her because she grew up in service. Nemesis has assigned her a partner for this mission. Ada only knows it is a man, posing as a footman. She only hopes it is not Michael who she worked with last time. Things got rather personal with Michael, and Ada was very hurt that she's never heard from him in the past six months after the mission.

Michael, who also grew up in service, specifically asked for this assignment so he could see Ada again. He is hoping that, in addition to getting the evidence they require, that perhaps things can start again with Ada.

I really liked how this whole novella pretty much took place ""below stairs"" from the servants' point of view. Michael and Ada have to sneak around constantly, even with the other servants, because if anyone suspects anything going on romantically between them, they'll get sacked. That helps build the romantic tension in the story. Recommended for readers who like the full-length Nemesis books.",0

Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Another thoroughly captivating, kept-me-up-reading-all-night story by Josh Lanyon. The story being told in Griff's POV really worked for me, I really connected with him, and reveled in experiencing everything through his eyes, and having access to his impressions of everyone he met. Griff and Pierce made for deliciously intriguing main characters, both having their demons and past hurts to deal with, a past Pierce was so reluctant for Griff to open again..but which he eventually benefited from. The author once again gifts readers with a substantive and poignant portrayal of the human heart.

I loved the distinctiveness of all the secondary characters, each of whom had a crystal clear portrayal.  The Long Island setting and mystique was a character in its own right - I love when an author portrays setting so vividly that I feel as if I am a participant within the story and not simply reading it. The mystery held so many possibilities, just when I thought I was sure of one facet, I found myself doubting... excellent maneuvering of plot, with a great twist at the end. I'll be reading this one again - even though I now know the outcome of the mystery... the lovely nuanced writing style of Mr. Lanyon freely lends itself to new discoveries upon re-reading.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Yes, this is a new writing style for the talented MS EDWARDS.  She has shown more talent than when she wrote as MS NICOLE EDWARDS. And, I didn't know that there ever was that much talent had existed.  Being able to write books that are that good and being that different is phenomenal. We are talking like two completely different people.

The book was great. I'm so excited about this series. And I can't wait for the next book.  This review will have no spoilers as I don't include them.  They can ruin a book if you include them in a review.

The editing was good.
The characterization was more than great.  All the characters had a perfect role they played.  Each of them could have their own unique story.
The storyline was unique and not boring. You are always waiting for the next page.
I gave it a 4.5 stars and then rounded it down. There was one or two chapters that was a little slow. But that was all.

I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I URGE YOU TO READ THIS FIRST BOOK OF THE SERIES.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU WILL WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SERIES.
SO, GET THE BOOK AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Leigh finally has to face the fact that she does indeed have feelings for Ryan that go deeper than surface lust. But she's still a girl who does her best to stay rooted in reality, and without concrete answers about where Ryan came from, it's difficult for Leigh to let go and fully trust the man who has her heart.

I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of More Than Words. What struck me most is that this conclusion is a delightful mix of the distinct mythology that played out in Unchained Melody and the charming elements of Contemporary Romance that went into Turn The Page. Add in some intensely heated bedroom scenes and seriously swoon-worthy actions by Mr. Weaver, and you've got a conclusion with some bite.

All of the events from the first two books come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotions and have to confront many truths about his past.

If you're on the hunt for something that feels both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K. Munt delivers another memorable book hunk that rivals Tristan from her well-known Fairytail Saga. This is the kind of romance that should be accompanied by a folding fan.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Seven-year-old Eric has always had an active imagination and a fascination with snow and cold weather. Initially, his father Ben doesn't think that his son's talk of a magical kingdom known as Lukana is anything more than a little boy's typical childhood imagination. Ben, himself, prefers the summer, while his late wife Jamie - Eric's mother - loved the winter. Jamie died giving birth to Eric, but her final act in life was to apologize to Ben.

Ben never knew exactly why Jamie apologized to him, although he vowed to himself that as his son grew, Eric would always be loved. Then, one winter day, Eric sculpts a snow owl in the backyard. With such a simple and childish act, Eric unwittingly sets in motion a series of events that cannot possibly be anything but magical. Now Ben faces the terrifying prospect of losing his only child to a wintry spirit...a spirit that just might be the boy's true father.

I must say that I chose this book because I liked the cover. I also enjoy reading fantasy, and was curious to see how the story would eventually pan out. I give this story an A! - It was a quick and engaging read, and I look forward to reading more from Jon Hartling in the future.",0
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This book is typical of the genre and is filled with angst, smoking hot scenes and complete and utter denial and misunderstandings. It covers all of the bases that fans have come to expect. Two people who are complete opposites find themselves attracted to each other but have a million reasons why they can't be together.

This is the first book in the Lost Boys series and it is safe to say that Devlin is a little lost and a whole lot bad. Sometimes I find myself really getting behind this kind of character but there was something about Devlin that was holding me back. I didn't love him as much as I would have liked and I found that a little disappointing. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly was off but it was definitely something. Perhaps it was some of his questionable moves. I'm not sure. He just didn't seem as sincere in regards to Rena as I would have liked. Rena was also a little on the weak side for my liking as well. Their relationship lacked the depth that I was craving.

Although I did find the characters a tiny bit weak it was still an entertaining and easy book to read. I think there is promise for future instalments of this series.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Back in 2011 I got a chance to read Because of You by Jessica Scott. This is where you first meet Shane Garrison and Jen St. James. I strongly suggest you read that story first, before jumping into this novella. However, it is just a suggestion. Here's why:

In Anything for You Shane and Jen have been together for sometime. Shane is about to do something and he's afraid to tell Jen what he is about to do. I don't know what the man was thinking when he thought it was a good idea not to tell Jen. Fortunately, he has a good buddy who has talked some sense into him. I know this is very vague, but it's a novella. If I say to much, I might tell the whole story. Plus, a lot of the background is in the first book of the  Coming Home series. Overall, it is a quick read (seriously) in which you get to see Shane and Jen work out there relationship and over come there fears of what could happen. It was enjoyable and it's nice to see Jen and Shane again. So, I actually hope you get to read both stories Because of You and Anything for You. So, I leave you today and I hope it's wonderful.",0
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Overall, this is a cheesy, predictable, but cute little romance/chick lit.

It's one of those books where the reader can figure out the general plot within a few pages. There are no surprises here! That said, other than the main character's total inability to figure out her flatmate's motives, these are likeable characters (Josh is practically saintly, which stretches suspension of belief to an extreme) and it's a fun, if rather far-fetched, plot.

However, it could so easily have been a good deal better. Romantic comedies, be they in films or books, are generally thoroughly predictable, but there's foreshadowing and then there's LOOK THIS IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. A touch more subtlety would not have gone amiss! It is at least fairly short, or the plot would get even more contrived.

On top of that, it needs a good proofread to weed out the careless mistakes. Lots of capitalisation of speech tags, words missing out, misused/typo'd words (were for wear, for example), etc. Generally I don't expect perfection from self-pubbed efforts, but I do expect the writer to take a little more time to fix basic, easily corrected errors like this.

So... reasonably engaging characters, and the book is entertaining enough (with at least one laugh-out-loud moment), but if I'd paid list price for it, I'd feel pretty short-changed.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Ms. Toon is an amazing story teller.  Whenever I read her books I know I won't be bored.  In fact, I was reading another book but stopped to read this one when an email alerted me that it was now available for purchase.

She did not disappoint.  Don't let the fact that it is a YA book deter you.  It is still a wonderful story that kept me engaged.  I read it in less than 24 hours.

I really enjoyed Jessie's story and her coming to terms with her mother's death and finding out her biological father is a rock star.  I'll never be in that exact situation but it was fun and full of drama but still realistic and down to earth if that makes sense.  It was easy to relate to Jessie.  It was also fun catching up with Meg and Johnny.

I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars because I do feel that some of situations in the book were a bit mature for younger audiences.  There is drinking, and smoking.  *spoiler alert* The characters don't go further than kissing but I feel that some terms used were a bit mature.  That's probably just me though.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel. For fans of YA fantasy adventures about a teenage boy, this story is a recommended read.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Well, this was just a wonderful book. I've read a few of Kenny Wright's stories now, and really enjoy his light and bouncy style, and the fantastic suspense that just keeps you captivated - and unable to keep from turning to the next chapter time after time.

This is his first full-length novel, and it's a real treat. It is a self-contained sequel to a short-story entitled Rediscovering Danielle, and you don't have to read that at all to enjoy this one - although I'd recommend reading both, the short story nicely sets up the characters and their backstory and is a highly entertaining read in its own right.

Just Watch Me takes Dean and Danielle to exotic Hawaii, where the atmosphere lends itself well to  taking their little marital game of hubby-watching-wife-flirting-in-a-bar a little further, into the saucy realms of actually (gasp!) seeing her with other people. The story is well-paced and explores the whole risk-and-reward dilemma of a married couple very much in love challenging themselves sexually with the tickle of jealousy to fan their passions - it's naughty, it's spicy, it's so hot with scenes that will lodge firmly in the memory, but Kenny Wright plays it just perfectly in teasing out the nervous energy without piling on the pain, and leaving you with a satisfying HEA.",0

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Michael G. Thomas is a well known author when it comes to science fiction novels and it definitely shows. He did really well with the third installment of the Star Crusades: Mercenaries series, ""War of the Exiles"".

I was introduced to the series from a friend of mine that knows I am not a big sci-fi fan but after I read the first book - I just kept going. The book is a great example of a military sci-fi that puts you on a action packed journey full of surprises. The character development is top notch and the book is very well written. I personally fell in love with the character ""Spartan"" the most. The book has a ton of stuff going on including some terrorism which I believe is a way of connecting the reader to a more present state of whats currently going on around us in today's society. When you get into these books you will start noticing the author has a full on fictional universe going on inside his head not just a single story. I would compare it to something along the lines of Game of Thrones but in space with the depth in each series.

Highly recommend the book to anyone who loves sci-fi / military books or just anyone looking for a great read in general.",0
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"This is one of those marriages of convenience, a trope I often like.  The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever imagine.  A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equals or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior.

She runs away from home to escape marriage and he runs away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Well, you know what will happen by reading the blurb but not exactly all the particulars, some of which are fun and interesting.  No real unicorn here, of course, but the symbolism plays a part in the story.  There are also some entertaining secondary characters, although nobody is drawn with much dimension.

However, this is not Chater's best work.  I did not like the hero much. Too immature, too erratically friendly and then cold and almost mean to the heroine.  Still, the writing is good.  Chater knows her way around words and sentences, but I have to like the hero in my romance to be completely satisfied.",0

This book is Ms. Livesay's debut with Avon Impulse and I think they have found a promising author.

I definitely enjoyed this book.  It's a sweet story about accepting those we love for who they are and seeing the potential in them.  Chelsea and Adam were a cute couple.  I loved Adam and his inability to lie.  He is a genius with a form of Aspergers that makes him very literal. It was actually kind of refreshing and made him more vulnerable.  Chelsea grew up in poverty and sees her success as a way to prove she is better than her adolescent life. She has some lessons to learn about what is really important.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I absolutely love this new author. I think he has a big future in the world of fantasy. I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that rule the underworld, their connection to the watch keepers, the three princesses and their guardian knights, the forest made out of memories that light up, the identity of Pandora, it all took me on a wonderful journey where I savored every page. I tend to evaluate fantasy authors on the uniqueness and the beauty of the world they unroll for us,and the intelligence of overall design - Ronnell D.Porter passed with flying colors. I read a lot of fantasy and consider myself picky within the genre; it is difficult for me to find the author who has it all and settle with the book, so I am totally rejoiced with discovering this one.
On the matter of typos: there are a lot, but no more than in an average advanced reader copy. I wish them gone, but I have noticed that the author is donating all the proceeds from the books to the Breast Cancer and Save The Children foundations and professional editors cost a lot.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Ruthie Knox is a new to me author. About Last Night put her on my must buy list. The characters are realistic with flaws for both Cath and Nev that makes your heart ache for them on their journey for their HEA (happily ever after).

Cath comes from a hard life where she regrets choices she made. She doesn't feel worthy of Nev. She puts limitations on their relationship to keep from making the same mistakes. Gradually, the limitations change as Cath changes.

Nev has his own struggles with family and career choice. He goes along with Cath's limitations because he wants to breakdown the walls around her heart. However, for them to find their HEA, Nev also makes changes to merge together the two sides of his character (who he is and who his family wants him to be).

This combination of character struggles and development makes for a great read that had me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next and how they would overcome it all for HEA.

The book is set in England. Ms. Knox did a great job of writing Nev true to his background with English terms and sayings that added to the story and character.

Joy song & the happy dance might've made a brief appearance.
This third of the new trilogy is excellent!! :)  The author took a mediocre, at best, short story & turns it into an incredible novel!!  She superbly snakes around the existing material and proficiently pours powerful scenes into the narrative that grab your attention and not let it go.  Also, I really like that she is keeping this trilogy in the same universe of "" The Blood & Bones Trabsolutely cake &It means we already have a basic working knowledge of the paranormal place & persons.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I finished Ambassador: Seeing Red, today. I loved this book.

Patty Jansen has done a remarkable world building job, building a complex interplanetary society structured around 'gamra,' with earth and humanity as we mostly know it, sitting on the periphery. Cory Wilson is earth's second ambassador to 'gamra' - but the first ambassador who actually understands the society he's about to be thrust into.

The politics, cultural differences and language differences are complex, but well developed and understandable, and I was easily drawn into the world that she created. At times I felt as hot and bothered and exhausted as Cory, struggling to adapt to the heat of a world far from earth, or as frozen as Thayen, drenched and shivering from experiencing temperatures well below her norm.

The story moved rapidly, and I was drawn in very quickly, and kept tapping the pages of my kindle much longer than I should really have been awake.

I've been reading Science Fiction for a long time. This story is good. It's not simplistic, but neither is it so far out of left field that it has more culture than character. It's a really good tale with enough twists and turns to keep you flicking the pages, and the characters are real and develop from moment to moment. I'm now looking forward to reading the next one.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Best Laid Plans is like no other book I've read before. The story is action packed, raw, gritty and beyond entertaining. There are funny bits, and of course romance. But the best part is the two awesome main characters.

Stylo's writing style is one of my favorites. She captures your attention from the first pages of her books and this one is not different. At the same time, this book is nothing like her others. I felt like I was watching an action movie while reading it. Her attention to details and how well researched everything in her books is doesn't go unnoticed. It makes the experience of reading this book feel much more real.

The story is incredibly well written. The descriptions of the places make you feel as if you're there. The characters are intriguing, and captivating. Marc and Lily are headstrong, brave and they are focused on getting their respective jobs done. These two make quite the dynamic duo. They had me clutching my heart, laughing and swooning.

Not only the main characters are intriguing, the side characters as well. Kingsley, is I have to say, one of my favorite things about his book, and I'm hoping we get a lot more from him.

These are not supposed to mix in a relationship, but you know what happens when something's forbidden...

Zach's character is tormented and has never gotten past losing his love over three hundred years ago.  It is easy to empathize with him, and to understand why he keeps Shasa at arms length.  I did have a difficult time seeing the two of them together, for some reason they just did not click for me...I just didn't feel that spark between them, I'm not sure exactly why.

The story itself moves well, the second half quicker than the first mostly due to the action and drama that is occurring at that point.  I was able to read this in less than a day, and found the story easy to follow even though I haven't read anything else from this series yet.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"It's always fun to find a new author to enjoy!  This second in the BBB series was just as good as the first book.  Both leads were very likeable, the secondary characters were fabulous, and the storyline flowed smoothly with easily solved conflicts.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is a beautifully-written book by a highly literate author who has a respect for the written word. No gimmicks, no hype, nothing that's cheap about the all-important subject of coming of age...how refreshing! Reading the chapter titles alone is stimulating, because you get a glimpse of the structure of the book without being told the exact details (which of course, entices you to want to see how the story plays outs).

The realism of the book draws the reader in effortlessly. The journey is epic and dramatic without being formulaic or repetitious. There are many poignant lines throughout the content too, which give the book added depth and insight. I think the following line (from one of the chapters in The Same Moon) describes the book very well: ""Life was no film set, and there was no script."" I particularly enjoyed Chapter Five: The Courtship for its unabashed view on ""the dating game.""

As someone who enjoys culture and travelling, this book was certainly a treat. The strength of books like these is that they remind discerning readers how literature is differentiated from the film medium. While the latter tends to be more impressive in terms of 'visuals', good literature is intimate because it engages the reader through a one-on-one experience.

As a novella, the story ramps up to speed quickly.  Moeller does a very good job introducing new elements, like hyperspace and its risks, plus the equipment aboard the spaceship, all in the middle of a steady stream of exploits and conflicts the characters must deal with.

Everything comes together in a nice package.  The action is well done and kept me furiously turning pages.  But wait, theres more.

Mixed in with hyperspace and spaceships is the interesting concept of hyperspace microbes that can possess a human mind, driving the person insane.  These microbes are kept out of the spaceship by a special shield, so there shouldnt be any problems, right?

Thats where the plot pulls off some unexpected twists and turns, making for a fun read.  Moeller keeps up the pace all the way to the end.  Amazingly, for a novella there is much more that could be said, but I fear explaining anymore will reveal too much.

Too often, shorter stories leave me feeling unsatisfied.  But not Hyperspace Demons.  Interesting story.  Well told with plenty of action and a surprise or two thrown in.  Good job Jonathan Moeller.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"*I was given a copy of this book as a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed this story. Hud and Mack are great! It is the third book in the series but can be read by itself (or first) without any problem whatsoever. It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone was sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud has been playing football for 10 years and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interactions together and the building of their relationship. It was genuine and believable for me. Nothing was rushed or forced. I was able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football has reached the playoffs and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship. I loved how the football and romance were mixed together. It was a great blend and I felt like I got enough of both, rather than feeling like I was missing something somewhere. I really enjoyed the characters and this story.

Logan was the one night stand.

Cass is Logans boss but she has no clue about his secret that could change everything.

This book started off at a steady pace, then it slowed down in the middle and hit it's stride again in the last 3rd.

Cass and Logan are both head strong and career driven. They have different experiences in life and this shows in each interaction they have. Because of the complexity of their situation there are a lot of undercurrents in their conversations, but only one of them is aware of it.

The author has done a good job showing the different sides to her characters personalities. The chemistry between Logan and Cass never diminishes and the love they have for their daughter despite the intricacies they face shines through and comes above everything else.

I enjoyed this story. The characters and the storyline is consistent and interesting and I liked the dynamics of the other relationships each Cass and Logan have with others such as Logan's grandmother and Cass's friend Patricia. Those relationships added another layer and also a bit of lightness to the storyline.

This is a great holiday read and worth one clicking if you like a good romance!

The author has written something reminiscent of the film ""You've Got Mail"". A shop, The Gingerbread Cafe, has been in a small town for years, and has been an extremely successful business. Then someone else comes in and opens up something similar right across the road (as opposed to 'just around the corner' in the film.)

This starts a battle between the 2 proprietors to gain business from the townsfolk.

Who will win? Will it be the reliable young woman, Lily, who has been a constant in the lives of her customers for years? Or will it be the young interloper, Damon, who triumphs due to his good looks and apparently irresistible charm?

The author has written a lovely novella, with just the right tone and information, to make this a great story.

The character of CeeCee, Lily's partner in crime in the cafe, is a great one! She is such a sassy woman.

My only gripe is that the story wasn't longer! I would love to know more about Lily and the cafe, CeeCee and her family, and the heartache Lily went through a few years before. Perhaps a prequel in the making? Hint hint Ms Raisin?

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Well--appears Fiona Gavelle is up to her legal antics again.  And her writer, Una Tiers, is up to her tricks again, delivering yet another page-turner with ""Not Safe for the Bank(er)"".

Ms Tiers calls it a short story.  I would bicker with that classification and call it, rather, a novella, or, a short novel.  It provides all the satisfaction one receives from a work that is longer than a short story, in that allows for a fuller development of character, and a plot that can be more convoluted with considerably more back story.

Fiona Gavelle was introduced in ""Judge vs. Nuts"" as a newbie attorney solving a murder mystery while stumbling and tripping her way through a legal system that doesn't favor the still innocent and idealistic attorney in her dealings with the ""good ol' boys"" of the bar.

In this book, we get the feeling that Fiona, thank goodness, still hasn't lost her innocence and idealism while doing the leg work for her client-by-default, Mr. Fives.  (You'll have to read it to find out just how he fell in her lap--but it's an enjoyable challenge).

Between the first book and this one there is a perceptible growth and maturity in the character of Fiona Gavelle.  But it is refreshing to rediscover that the revolving door still can slap her in the butt.

When those kids are grown and gone you can find your own freedom and a new life if that's what you need to. But to walk away from your wife, leave your children to live in a single parent home for your own emotional needs? Selfish beyond description. As for the feelings of his new love, the other woman? I had no sympathy for her in any shape or form - so she fell in love, so what? She knew he was married and she trespassed anyway. None the less, I will read other work by this author on a different subject matter, she definately knows how to tell a story.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Television reporter Jessica Rowan is covering the San Antonio Generals bachelor auction and is livid after her friend, Charlene Simmons, bids for her to win a date with NHL winger, Ryder Carrigan. The last thing alternate captain, Ryder Carrigan, wants to do is participate in a bachelor auction.  However, when the two meet they might have more in common than they would have expected.  This contemporary sports romance is suitable for new adult and adult audiences.

I like Ryder.  He is serious about hockey to a fault.  I appreciate after Ryder was called out by one of his teammates, he realizes that he needs to achieve more balance in his life.  This is a valuable life lesson that can benefit everyone.  I felt bad that Jessica was blindsided at the auction, but I love that her friend bid on Ryder for her.  They have some obstacles to overcome that make the story interesting. The two have great chemistry and make an excellent couple.

At ninety-seven pages, this story is a fast and captivating read that I finished in one sitting.  I enjoyed the charity scene in the beginning and thought that was a clever way for the characters to get together.  Chasing the Prize is a fun story and entertaining read.

If this novella (or short, I guess) is a ploy to get readers to need to read on in the series, then congratulations, because the author has succeeded. This is definitely a great introduction to some of the character's in Kemmerer's Elemental world. I liked the two main character's a LOT. The writing has an easy simplicity to it that helps with the cadence of reading. It's full of conflict-romance, too, but without being overly mushy, which can sometimes happen in YA.

Though I'm left with quite a lot of questions: how their `powers' work because that isn't fully explained; the why and wherefore of it all isn't in here; I'm left unsure whether or not regular humans exist around these `special' folk, or of the hierarchical structure of it all and why certain families are expected to obey the requests of others/or stick to agreements made with them; there is evidently some kind of societal ladder and which rungs people belong on is obviously an important part of the world created here ...

Okay in one word is WOW. This is the first I have read from Mary Smith and have to say this is not your usual sports romance book. What got me about this book that made it so easy to love was its characters. I loved that you have a person like Meadow who seems like she is at the top of the romance world she is just like all of us waiting for her Prince Charming. The storyline pulled me in and though it is the first in a series I am already loving it for there was so much more between Meadow and Kyson. The cute way they completed each other and easy way there were towards each other is what makes its characters so memorable. Kysons attitude about a cover model was genuine to the point of making him think of Fabio was hillarious. Meadow now is a woman I loved right away for she reminded me of me with insecurities, fear yet still with hope her one love will appear. Mary Smith just wowed me since this is the first I have read from will definitely keep up with her work. Get this book you won`t be disappointed from the camaraderie between its characters, the love between Meadow and Kyson even his teammaters were awesome. Can`t wait for Book 2 in this series.",0

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"So this is a series novel....not a big fan of those. Since this book is the start of the series, you would think that the author would have taken her time setting the story up. When the H and h meet for the first time the chemistry is instantaneous. I'm okay with because sometimes in life you meet a person and that can happen. HOWEVER, to have these two meet have sex and then decide they are in love? I'm calling straight BS on that. And what man wants to dive head first into some woman's drama because she's so beautiful and he just has to have her in his life?  And here we go once again with the black woman always having green eyes ,hazel eyes, light brown eyes,etc. Why not just beautiful brown eyes? I'm being petty sorry. Anyway the story although good moves along way too fast for me. They meet..she introduces him to her drama...he protects...they have sex...her life gets threatened again...there's a big dramatic scene with the villain H saves the day... this time they have unprotected sex...then proposes like a week later or three months later...either way. Too soon. I like it when a relationship gets to marinate the characters get to know each other the chemistry and suspense build up so that we can genuinely be excited when the two main characters come together...none of that happened here.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.

It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.

I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending.

 - She told me that this life on earth was just a test for us to go to heaven. She said that the true at heart die young because they don't need to live the trial like others.
 - This trip was about being able to forgive myself.

Jared Corbit is her sister Lexis boyfriend and she wished she felt brotherly thoughts towards to him. What was she going to do?

Told from Savannahs point of view, her emotional turmoil feels so real. There seems to be one punch after another to herself and those around her and the anguish and she feels cannot be hidden. The author knows just the right thing to say to convey the mood, the feelings of uncertainty, pain and love. And there is a lot of love in this story despite tackling the serious issues. Abuse and its ripple effect, abandonment and its life-long consequences are at the center of Savannahs struggle as she tries to deal with her family and the situation she finds herself in now.

Chantal Fernando's incredible writing combined action packed scenes and a healthy dose of freaking HOT characters and their kick ass love interests has become a knockout favourite of myself and many, and I for one cannot wait for Vinnie's story (Wolf's Mate) out in August.

Talon is an interesting character that has all the bad assery of an MC President of the Wild Men MC with the sweetness of a Wind Dragon MC Hottie. I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.

Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.

As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.

The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.

Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's.

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"I read this book all of the way through. He explains a lot of things about quantum physics and other related subjects thoroughly. In fact, it was the most concise explanation for the new scientific discoveries that I have read in one book. But where the author goes wrong, in my opinion, is when he acts as though the Law of Attraction and its related theories work to make you wealthy. He says that all you have to do is have positive thinking and you will attract wealth and other great things into your life. The reason why I have singled out wealth is because he does. He believes that you can become a millionaire and even a billionaire if you use the Law of Attraction correctly.

After talking and talking about his concepts I jumped ahead to the author's story. I wanted to see what the Law of Attraction had brought into his life. He said he was doing well with his software company but he lost everything. Immediately after losing everything he wrote this book. I had to laugh! What better proof that the author didn't know what he was talking about can be inferred by his situation? Naturally, if his concepts worked he would be a successful billionaire by now! If you want to read about the recent revelations about quantum physics this is an excellent book to read. Other than that, at least it was free.",0

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"First of all if you are looking for a clean recency novel, pass this one up. 2nd although I really liked the plot, it was lost in the morass of passionate kissing and longing for one another that began about half way through. Now none of this was explicit at this point, just distracting talk of passion and desires. But it was constant on and off between the plot, so the desire and passion overtook the nice laid out plot already in place. 3rd at the end not too surprising the hero and heroine could not wait to have sex, before they got married, and they did this in the hero's house with his mother and sister there. He said his mother would be happy to see her in the morning at breakfast...  REALLY! This is regency era, no mom is happy to wake up and find out your son had his girlfriend come over in the middle of the night to sleep with him and then have breakfast with the family. BTW, before sleeping together he did propose at least. I can't tell you exactly how explicit the love scene was, as I glanced at it only enough to skip the pages to the ending. I was disappointed.

Not only is I Let You Go a fast paced physiological thriller it's also a intimate portrail of tragedy, loss, survival, and emotional undoing.

When I sleep Im assaulted by the sights and sounds of the accident; by the knowledge that had I been just a few minutes earlier, it would never have happened Jenna feels responsible for the tragedy and won't allow herself to find joy in anything as she feels she doesn't deserve it. She moves to a small town in Welsh to try and put her life back together. While there she is withdrawn from everyone and everything. Eventually she finds a small amount of happiness in taking photographs. About half way through the book their is a major twist that I for one did not see coming. The author portrays Jenna in such a way that you actually feel like you are in the book with her. The book is a devastatingly real look at how tremendous tragedy and guilt can affect every aspect of ones life to the point it can be debilitating.

Juno is living a dull life that is until the ghost of her mother shows up and starts to liven her life up which takes Juno down the path of reevaluating her life and wondering is she really living or has she been playing it safe this entire time. **Spoilers** There were so many times I wanted to shake some sense into Juno and point out all things she was ignoring about her life, like 1) being that her and her fiance Evan and her are better off as friends than a couple, 2) that her ""best friend"" is in love with Evan and that's why she never takes her side whenever they discuss what's going on in her relationship with him. 3) That her so call friend/co-worker is desperately trying to ride her back up the ladder instead of climbing up it himself, 4) that she doesn't want to climb up the ladder because she doesn't like her job, 5) that her and her neighbor from across the hall have sizzling sexual chemistry that you can start a fire with unlike her dull and routine relationship with Evan. *End of spoilers* Good book just wish it had more ghost interaction between her and her mother, would love a second book of Juno meeting Ryder's family and her seeing more ghosts.",0

You seemed like such a normal guy, such a hard-working, misunderstood everyman, but with this...dark underbelly.""

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I have read several of the stories in this series and this one is probably the most hilarious. In this series men can get pregnant. It's actually the way they know that the other man is their true mate. And all have to get over some obstacles to reach their HEA.

Bobby decides that he has to get away from his family. After having seen his brother be awfully abused by their own father and knowing that his fate would be similar when his true nature was revealed, he knows he must seek out. Stupidly enough he starts his get away journey on a very cold night. Poorly dressed he is fortunate to meet Nick and his two friends who are driving aimlessly around. They deliver him at the ranch where his brother Isaac is living with his mate.
Bobby meets his own mate there, but he does not want to give in, not to begin with anyway. It takes some effort from Shott and help from among others Shott's grandfather before the stubborn Bobby realizes where his future lies.

There are some quite distinct hints as to who Nick actually is and some magic wielded to underline that. There is a mentioning of a crossroad demon. And the solution as to who had sent the killer after Bobby is not easy to accept.

I have the feeling this might be last book of this series, but there is always Mason who still is without a mate.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I've heard a lot about Alisha Rai but I've never actually read any of her work before PLAY WITH ME. Whoo, now I'm starting to think I should correct that...because this book is hot!

Tatiana and Wyatt were teenage lovers. Then they had a bad split. Now, Tatiana is about to contact Wyatt again for the first time in years because, by striking coincidence, it turns out that her biological brother (with whom she recently met for the first time) has gotten in trouble for stealing from Wyatt's casino and he and his young family can't afford the consequences if Wyatt presses charges. Tatiana is hoping to plead her brother's case.

Typed out like that, it kind of sounds like the set-up to some bad porn. Which, technically, I guess it is. PLAY WITH ME is an erotic short, clocking in at just over 100 pages, and about 85% of those pages consist of sex scenes, or build-ups to sex scenes.

But PLAY WITH ME is a cut above most erotica I've read. The characters are well written, with real flaws and insecurities. Their emotions are conceivably realistic. The dirty talk is good. The scenarios are well written, consensual, erotic, and somewhat inventive. Both the hero and heroine get off, and have open communication with one another about what they want and what their expectations are.

Dar/Mackenzie, she was a strong businesswoman, with an independent mind, she knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go for it. Her visit to the Hub, although not her first was interesting, she definitely got more than she had bargained for.  I loved her group of friends, Bella was a good friend, as was Mackenzie in return.

Kennedy had a strong group of friends too; in Julien, Reece and Grant.  We already know Reece's story and I'm sure Grant and Julien's are going to be Fab.  Although they were together for Reece's bachelor party, they really had Kennedy's back.

As eccentric as Julien is, he helped Kennedy see sense and made him realize he had been a fool.

As did Bella with Mackenzie, I loved the interaction between Mackenzie and her neighbor and his dog, she has a really caring nature.

The sexy scenes were fab, and I needed to fan myself more than once, not to mention other forms of relief :) !

I felt that although the story ended on a very good positive note, it would be great to have seen how they got on with the moratorium they had agreed to.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This very enjoyable story takes unusual directions from the start. Our heroine is a young woman of respectable background who has had her life ruined by a wealthy man. She has been banished to a convent. Meanwhile our hero is a man who went to America as a trader but took the losing side in the Civil War and has returned, with only a ship, to take up a family title. He learns that he will relinquish the lands if he does not marry and produce an heir by a certain date, which is only a few months away. This option appears to be impossible until as luck would have it, he meets our heroine who is in an interesting condition.

A somewhat creepy item is that the hero's ship carries the remains of his mother whom he wishes to bury on her family land. Why he could not do that without owning the land is unclear. The wish seemed tossed in to make the hero more altruistic and less land-grabbing. We are reminded of a certain character several times by the heroine pointedly asking what can have become of her or a message she carried. This builds to a suspense finale which again is most unusual in period romances.

Read, enjoy, be surprised. There is lots of fun historical detail such as how inheritance worked and this has to be explained to the hero for our benefit, he having been in America for twenty years.",0

This was an amazing continuation to the Levi and Nix's story that we begin in Body, Ink and Soul. This book picks up right where that book ended so we don't miss a beat (and if you remember the cliffhanger that book ended on you are going to be really glad the author made it a smooth transition!) this book has a few more difficult moments in it and it helps strengthen the love story. As they say in the book ""you have seen me at my best and now you've seen me at my worst"" and this story is a good example of love truly conquering all! We see all of our favorite characters from book 1 and get caught up on what is going on in their lives. I could see where there might be more books in this series because there are some relationships that beg to be explored!

There are plenty of the same tingles and warm fuzzies that the first book brought about which sometimes doesn't happen in a direct continuation novel but I was pleased to note that the same magic I discovered in book 1 was present and maybe even stronger as we see the next chapter in Levi and Nix's story.

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I really enjoy novels involving angels and demons so this was a given for me, especially considering it was published by Random House Flirt, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite publishing imprints. This novels plot kept me thoroughly engaged with its battle between good and evil. Sophia St. James moves to a small town in Connecticut, never expecting to see Guardian Angels in spirit form. In fact, she is the only one who can.
Sophia was a great character. She was strong and brave and I loved her narration. Michael was the angel. He was moody, protective, and volatile. It was really hard to figure out what he was feeling, but I loved his character nonetheless. He had good intentions. Dante was the Demon Knight who was convinced that the reincarnated soul of his lost lover was in Sophia. He was one of those evil characters you couldn't help but somewhat enjoy because of their passion for whatever they are doing. Regardless, I am definitely Team Michael. This novel had the typical love triangle (good boy, bad boy, and the girl stuck between) but it had a unique spin on it that prevented it from becoming a trope.

Youngs writing style makes you feel like you're sitting beside the characters listening to the story instead of reading it.  This up close and personal approach really drew me in until I couldn't put the book down.  I really, really enjoyed getting to know Harley better.  Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her makes it so much more real.  I feel like I understand Harley now.  Seeing what she thinks and learning her history makes her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know.  Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing.  I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now.  The contrast between the way the two main characters see themselves as compared to how they see each other definitely adds to the story.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"The book description basically tells you everything that you need to know about the plot.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.  Seriously... made me laugh almost every time.  And not because he was being intentionally funny.",0

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I received The Skeleton Garden from Netgalley, Alibi, and the Chatterbox program in exchange for an honest review.

The Skeleton Garden is the 4th book in a series about a gardener who seems to have bad things, i.e. bodies, turning up around her. And in this book there are actually a few. Pru, the main character is a gardener working with her older brother on the large garden of an English home, when they start digging up the yard to find out why a tree didn't grow, they come across a WWII plane and a skeleton. Not much later in the same hole another body appears and the town is excited to find out who committed the crime or if it was an accident.

This book had a very slow start, I have not read the first books in the series, so I really didn't have enough background about the characters to really feel for them - and even through the book, didn't really feel for them either. So it was hard to read. Yes the book picked up when the bodies started appearing and the investigations started but overall I was not feeling it.

I love a good mystery and this book did provide a few, which was nice, but not having connected with the characters I felt that something was missing for me. But like I said if you read the other books in the series, that may add to the connection with the characters that I did not have.",0
Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"Usually i get on an author about not being descriptive enough, this is one of the few that i wish he'd shut up. Here's a quick example.

""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""

That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.

Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

I haven't read the sample but i suggest you do, if you cant handle a book reading like i posted above, then i cant recommend this book and you should give it a pass.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

I would recommend this book for persons looking for a light, witty, quick read.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"As always, I am SMITTEN with Tessa Dare's characters and the situations they find themselves in. If nothing else, the cakes incident would have sealed the deal for how awesome Rafe was. Yet, there was so much more to this big, lovable rake.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

My heart was beating so fast and I had to put the book down a few times, I was so nervous about what was going to happen. This book takes on a serious situation and I thought L.G. Castillo handled it brilliantly. Seeing Cassie deal with what happened was heartbreaking and watching her over come it was empowering. This book had me yelling at both characters and praying that things would finally go right for them. Since I read this on a kindle at 71% I literally had to put the book down and take a moment to recover from what I had read. My heart just couldn't take anymore and the emotions I had, it was overwhelming but I needed to make sure these characters were going to be ok...they needed to be ok!

The Story of Cody and Cassie is heartbreaking and beautiful. I can't tell you enough how this book with so few pages can give you so much and make you feel like you read an entire novel with so many feels, good and bad.

Serena is such a lovely character! She has a good heart, but she isn't naive or crying her heart out over men. She is a good and loyal friend. She isn't fearless; she has fears that she deal with every single day. She is a good girl, but isn't judgemental regarding others who arent.

Linc is well..a good man / alpha male. He has this Youre mine - No one touches you thing, but he isn't overbearing. He protects with elegance, should I say. Hes quite the gentleman for an alpha male, too.

I have to say that everyone should have one Serena as a friend and definitely a Linc as a man!

Its beautifully written and everything fits perfectly!!

Intensity is a great book and I loved it!

I strongly recommend it!!

However, I would like to say that its the FIRST BOOK!! The story continues to the next book or books.

Personally, I strongly dislike when I don't know this fact before I read the book. I don't have an issue if its a 2 book story or a trilogy. But I do want to know beforehand. Unfortunately, it does not happen.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"As you all know, when Im reviewing a book Im big on storyline, character development and connection not only between the characters, but connecting with the book as well.

As far as sexual chemistry, Sky and Ford had it in spades. Every time they looked at one another they were either undressing each other with their eyes or bumping uglies like Jack rabbits. This book definitely didn't lack in the sex department. You were left with nothing less than pure blissful satisfaction, definitely no problem there.

Though Sky and Ford got off on the wrong foot in the beginning, you were able to see how there could be a connection between them once they started opening up to each other and realized they had quite a bit in common. I felt a bit torn because for me, their connection felt more rushed than natural.

Sadly that is kind of how I felt about Repair Me overall. The storyline was good but too much was happening too fast. Every time I would start to connect with the book and really get into it, another scenario was thrown at me to deal with but there wasn't enough time before the book ended for it to feel natural. Either the book needed to be longer or some of the situations needed to be left out in order for the story to develop naturally and really be able to sink your teeth into the book.

I believe this series has potential and I am curious to see what Jennifer does with book 2",0

From the prolog B. b had me hooked to read the story of Colt and Tuesday. I loved that girls attitude from the get go, I loved the way they met and how their world's literally colieded. Their backstories are masterfully intertwined with their present and just made you want to be part of their journey even more and get to know them and the family that Colt introduces Tuesday to. Colts explanation of family to Tuesday is perfect:

""You were raised believin' family is in your name - that it has something to do with blood. ""
""It has nothing to do with that s*** - that's all accidental b. s - the s*** your born into that you can't f***in' control. ""
""Family, are the people who are there for you, who've got your back, and you know dam good and well, you've got theirs too! You don't just run away from them!""

Tuesday has some knowledge of Colts world but from a twisted dangerous point of view, he introduces her to a safe version of the world of BDSM, that has her wanting more. Along the way you learn how his bond with his brother Kash was formed, you learn how important trust can be and the lengths the brothers will go to, to protect their family.

Tragic events following the 1916 Easter uprising sees the family at odds with each other and forced to move to London.
Young firebrand Danny is supporting the cause of an independent Ireland. This puts him at odds with his brother Patrick who decides to join the Royal navy. Jenny his spoiled sister finds herself penniless and forced to look for work. Her Fiance John, once a promising prospect, is arrested for his involvement in the uprising and imprisoned.
This book is meticulously researched and contains many period details that bring the story alive. The working conditions for the women in the munitions factories and the horrors of the battlefield are a brutal back ground that helped me feel a great deal of compassion for the family.
I especially liked the character of Jenny as she undergoes a complete transformation. She starts of as a spoiled and selfish girl, but through hardship her eyes gradually open and we see her grow into a confident, independent and intelligent young woman. The story ends in 1917 and as this is titled book 1, I hope that Ms Petken is already busy writing the follow up. There are turbulent times ahead for Ireland and Im sure well see Danny involved.

He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book. In ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life. Of course, ""Old Man,"" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy. A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?

As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it. I fully recommend ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. Anthony Trendl

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"*This Book Was Given To Me By The Author In Exchange For An Honest Review*

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

Feeling lost and in need of a girls night, she meets a handsome stranger in a bar. Warren turns out to be the spark she was missing in her life.

Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.

Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!

I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.

My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.

Scarlet was even worse. Instead of swallowing her pride, she nearly cost the destruction of her business. Not to mention, when she did swallow her pride, it was for the wrong reason. Sorry, hate to say this, but I didn't care for where it ended. Sure, time passed, but I felt that another book of them growing together versus a little tidbit about six months later, would have been the better choice.

As always with E.L. Todd, the writing isn't bad. It is quick and easy to pull through. Despite my dislike for these characters, I did like her writing enough to finish the book. I also like that Janice made an appearance and that Scarlet did grow a pair for her friend. I still feel Scar could have done something before this book, but I'm glad she did the right thing.

Really, the book wasn't bad, I just didn't care for where it was going where Sean and Scarlet are concerned.",0

This is a great standalone story and book three in the series.  Book One introduced the concept of two worlds post war, divided by hidden portals. Cascadia is a world without technology or motorized vehicles and it citizens have paranormal abilities the Pacificans covet. For years the Pacifican Army has created crime waves they attribute to the Cascadians, giving them the reason they need for sustaining funding and support to continue their troop numbers.  They also seek out descendents of Cascadians living in Pacifica who have paranormal abilities and force them into the army. Those who refuse are incarcerated.  The more promising of these Talents are sent to a research lab, The Institute.  That is where Vince Crawford has been held for the past ten years, refusing to give up information about a portal he discovered that led him to Cascadia and Zara Kane, the girl he fell in love with.

Zara had just told Vince she was pregnant when he disappeared. Thinking he abandoned her, she is shocked to learn he has been imprisoned the whole time. Fiercely determined to free him, she convinces her brother to help and uses her cloaking Talent to get Vince away from his work detail and to a safe house. But neither of the lovers are the same people they were before Vince was taken. Their resulting story is one of bravery, love and patience in the face of Vince's PTSD and the force of the Pacifican Army intent on recapturing their most valuable prisoner.",0

Grace Grainger is a journalist and a very good one.  She chooses to spend her time reporting on the lives of those who defend their country, living with them, much like her own tour of duty and is actually ""embedded"" into the team she is with.  Air Force Master Sergeant Josh Travers is a Pararescue Jumper and has done more than his share of tours overseas.  Both of them fantasize about the hot night they had with a stranger several years in the past, and both find themselves very surprised when in the heat of battle, the Pararescuer that comes to save the group Grace is with is the same hottie she got nasty with 3 years ago.

The Clue is a short book that is packed with information and then the beginning of a great story. The story begins with the main characters, Stephanie, and Tori. Stephanie is a teacher in her first year. She is a widow and has been engaged to a man named Henry since her husband died. They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.

This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way.

Dawn considers herself the outcast of her small beach community. She and her best friend Zeke since childhood, and the two are inseparable. They have an us against the world mentality, especially when it comes to the other kids their ages. Dawn is every teenage girl. She's trying to figure out who she is, who she wants to be, and what she wants out of life.

Shea moves in next door and immediately immerses herself into Dawn and Zekes world. She's different; free. A young girl with worldly knowledge beyond her years. But like a lot of free spirits, there's an underlying current running through them. Shea is an incredible character.

This book is hopeful and heartbreaking. I found myself more than one having to take a deep breath, clutching my e-reader to my chest, praying that what I thought was about to happen really wasn't going to. That's how well Lilliana wrote this story. You don't feel like you're reading a work of fiction, but rather that you're living it with them. Every scenario, every feeling, you are in. You feel right along with them. This isn't a lighthearted book, but that's not to say that there aren't lighthearted moments. And the supporting characters make the book very well rounded.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary. Some inconsistencies, like Tess's childhood first being described as constant movement from state to state as her mom switched boyfriends, but always after that she's described as having a hometown in NH that she was desperate to escape from.",0

A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

Although the author didn't state the Laws in the story she did refer to them.  In my opinion if they could break one, why couldn't they break another.  If so, then why did they need the mechanic.

Dunn is a space engineer that that goes from planet to planet for jobs.  He wakes up from hypersleep to handle his latest job, to fix the communications of a planet from which nothing has been heard for over twenty years.

I enjoyed the clear crisp writing, in the style of the early masters.  Up until the end, when I realized that the laws had been broken even though the author implied that the robots couldn't break the laws.  To be specific, the robots should not have been able to allow harm to come to any of the humans.

In addition, as to the last paragraph there was no foreshadowing or any support for what was happening.

So while I would love to read more by this author, I hope that she will stick to the rules she creates in her universe(s), or explain how/why they were broken or by-passed.

First Impression: Well-written, engaging, expertly executed, and FUN, a book after my heart. Chloe is a software analyst who works from home and only allows herself to truly experience lifeand sexwhen she goes to comic conventions, dressed in sexy cosplay costumes that give her the carefree confidence she lacks in her day to day life. She likes the role play a lot because she feels brave in the costumes, more in control of herself and her needs. It's at one of the conventions she goes to that she meets Grant Osprey and though they didn't share their real names, they did share a night together. A night Grant would like to repeat, despite the fact that his convention lover turns out to be his friend and business partner's little sister. Oops. I freaking loved this book! It's a quick, fast-paced read that immediately caught my attention and held me captive throughout my reading. Maybe it's the author's easy, seemingly effortless writing style, or maybe it's my own experiences with going to comic conventions and being amazed by all the costumes--a few of which my own niece has designed and worn, but I instantly fell in love with Chloe and Grant's story because I could relate to them on a very real scale. Which made for such a fun and enjoyable read for me.

It's written more like a detailed account of someones life. Like watching a real life family live and writing each conversation and event in detail.

For starters, Liz hates Jack and when her friend discovers a way to increase Liz's power, more than doubling her strength and giving her the tools she needs to defeat whatever it is that is lurking and killing in the shadows of Boston, she is repulsed. But after facing the demon on her own, and taking beating, Liz admits, she needs the help and goes Jack with an interesting proposal. If they have sex, she can absorb his power and become strong enough to kill the demon.

For a short paranormal romance, this book has spice and striking characters. As expected for this type of book, the pace was quick and never dull. However, as I was reading I felt as if this was a second book rather than a first in the series.

I enjoy books about the corporate world, especially relationships involving an executive and a lower level employee. In Tracy Wolff's Addicted, CEO Ethan Frost and intern Chloe Girard are madly in love.  Actually, the word madly is an understatement, their love is completely all-consuming, and as a result they are unable to function when they are apart from each other.

After reading the dramatic prologue, I was hooked, at least for a little while. Some of the scenes are repetitive....Chloe running away almost every time she and Ethan have a problem, Ethan waiting for Chloe to come back to him, and Chloe's inability to cope with her past, to name a few. The story is good, what there is of it. A little less sex and a little more plot would have made the book more interesting.

Ethan is a likable character, albeit a bit tortured by his lack of pure common sense. He may be uber smart when it comes to business mergers, but when love is involved, he is downright simple. He does not learn from his mistakes because he makes the same poor choices over and over again. Chloe is an intelligent young woman, however, she is quite immature when it comes to being in a relationship.

I have always been so intrigued with Tarzan and Jane and I thought there certainly isn't any harm is downloading a freebie from Amazon.

I wasn't disappointed but I also wasn't thrilled either. I would bet if I read this story as a full length novel, I'd have liked it a whole bunch more. One of the reasons I despise serial books is because each book leaves off on a cliffhanger and you are forced to buy the next installment to read on. I really really reallllly hate that. It is such a turn off for me. I'd rather have spent $5 and got the entire book than a grabby grab for a continuous purchases. Oh well, I knew that going in so I shouldn't really complain. Good on the author for letting it been known in the book blurb that it is a serial book before you buy.

The writing was really good. Great descriptions. Easy to follow and even though it was a novella, I got to know the characters pretty fast. Since it is an erotic novella, there are a few great steamy scenes. Of course you have to read further into the series to get the smoking steamy scenes.

In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.

The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.

However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Just finished reading Primacy of Darkness (Brooklyn Shadows Book 3) by Brock Deskins. This was a wild ride from Book 1 throughout and ending with Book 3. I must say this was my favorite of the 3. The first 2 Books set us up for the climatic energy in Book 3. I really liked that all the characters from previous books play a continued part in the ending of this Trilogy. Incredibly imagined, yet believable character. Imagine if you will,  Jack the Ripper returning to modern times as a vampire in Brooklyn, New York! If you cannot make that leap let Brock make it for you and take this journey along with Leo, Kat, Marvin, Vincent, Trinh, Carol and a motley crew of vampires, werewolves, bloodlings and humans good and evil on this amazing adventure. I look forward to reading much more of Brocks work in the future.

Synopsis (from back cover): Jack the Ripper, sadistic madman of old London, once thought long dead, has returned to New York in an effort to quench his thirst for blood and mayhem. When the city's vampire enclave finds itself insufficient to deal with a madman of Jack's caliber, Vincent, the enclave head, enlists Leo Malone to put the maniac down before he reveals the existence of vampires as he throws the city into the throes of chaos and terror. Leo soon finds that Jack is not the only monster with which he must contend. A ghost from his past has also seemingly crawled from its grave and seeks to put an end to him and the rest of his kind.",0

 5 STAR REVIEW 

Pennie loved to read and that is why she was involved in her monthly book club. She was always comparing those book boyfriends she was reading about. Her social life was missing between her school work and her tight budget there was not much for her to do. But her life would change forever once she finds face to face with Carter, a woman that stop at anything to obtain what she wants. Carter was a business woman and she knew she had to be ruthless in her cut-throat world. When she finds herself with Pennie she knew she wanted to have her, protect her and love her in her own way. However there is a whole lot of issues they will have to face in order for her to be happy with Pennie. Carter and Pennie don't have the conventional relationship, but they know they are good for each other but how far will they are willing to go to achieve their happily ever after?

Well let me tell something this is my first F/F romance and I was surprised how this book had so much to offer. The plot had you sucked in and you will want to read the whole book before you put it down. This book will show you the lengths someone is willing to go for the person they love and no matter how you get there the only thing matters is how you will take it from that point on. I love this book and I will recommend for everyone to read this book. Gifted by author in exchange for an honest review. https://www. facebook.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him?
I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is. I have always wanted to find a good series to read where the main character always continues on and their story develops as the world continues. I do believe I have found that story. Move over Sookie Stackhouse, Dorian Devil is the new main character to follow.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,CG,"This review is for one of the free books in this series.  This is the first book in the series.  The second book is also free.

This is a short story with a lot of sexual tension.  The story is told in two parts.  The first part is a fast paced story.  The second part is a more mature story.  I liked it a lot.  The story is told from the POV of the main character, Luke, who is a vampire hunter.  The sex scenes are very hot.  I liked that the main character, Luke, was a bit of a jerk, but it didn't bother me that he had a big heart.  The story was a bit different from the first book in the series.  I will be reading the first book in the series.

This book was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.  I was not disappointed in this book.  It was a good story.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  The characters were well written.

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"It was so freaking long! There was just too much detail and I really didn't need to know every move they made every day. Very flowery, sappy dialogue was used a lot. I disliked Chase's prejudiced generalization that bisexual men are predisposed to cheat because they are attracted to both sexes. Cheaters are predisposed to cheat and it has nothing to do with sexuality. And he had that viewpoint prior to the boyfriend that cheated with a woman.

I also disliked the fact that Gray spent 10 years with Devon and dismissed it all so casually. Devon should never have cheated and never should have stayed if their relationship was so bad for 4 whole years. Maybe he was as manipulative as he was depicted. But Gray should be blamed as well, when he was the one avoiding intimacy and was too lazy and too complacent to make a clean break. Also, later in the book, he said he owned his house before Devon and Devon only lived there for a year. After 10 years together? That makes no sense.

I know that much of the story was introducing characters for future stories and I liked some of them. I did make it through the whole story but it was a chore. I never connected with the characters. They both seemed immature in many ways. Their little breakup was ridiculous and was no more than a setup for another long sappy make up scene. Added nothing to the book. So I might read the next book because of other characters but only if they're written more cleanly and with less syrupy dialogue.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I've read a lot of new adult romance books lately, so I've seen how a lot of them are the same, or how they differ.  I think anyone who reads a lot will kind of fall into that trap sometimes.  We always want something similar, but... not too much, you know?  To recapture that feeling that we had while reading something else, but to get a sense of more and a feeling of excitement, too.

This book is definitely that.  Right from the start, the entire thing catches you.  I honestly didn't expect what I was reading, but I liked it.  Caught and roped in, basically, and I wanted more.

Hopelessly Broken definitely provides more, too.  There's a lot going on in this book.  The characters are interesting and realistic.  I really enjoyed reading about Aeron especially.  I don't know that I've seen any character quite like him in another book.  Jenn's struggles are oftentimes something I think a lot of us can relate to, also.  Maybe not exactly, but the ideas and concepts behind them, you know?  I don't want to give too much away, but for a book like this to be as realistic was it was, I was impressed with how Tawny Taylor went about it.

One warning is that there's apparently another one planned for the future, so you're definitely going to want to keep an eye out for that.  Hopelessly Broken is on the longer side, though, so it's definitely really satisfying on its own.  I can't wait to read the second part!",0

It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

The Nameless Dwarf Omnibus contains the first three stories following the dwarf known only as Nameless.  If you have read some of Derek's other work than you may be familiar with him as he has been a companion of Shadrak the Unseen and Deacon Shader.

The book starts out with Nameless being a very mysterious figure who has hired a boy from the Night Hawks (a criminal group) to help him find information on where his people have fled to.  Nils, his companion, is the son of the leader of the guild out to prove his worth as a man.  During the journey they meet up with Silas, a magic user, who is studying the stolen grimoire of the Liche Lord Otto Blightey.  At the end of Ant-Man Ilesa joins up with the group as well.  She is a woman who seems to have some level of skill with shapeshifting/illusion magic.  As the stories progress the characters true natures are revealed as their stories are unraveled.  Derek has done a wonderful job keeping the main story on point while gradually revealing the backgrounds of all the people involved.

The book starts out with a lot of information and someone who is unfamiliar with the world Derek has created might struggle a bit at first.  As the book progresses everything comes together beautifully and by the end I didn't want to stop reading for any reason.  I will also be checking out the next story in the series, The Ebon Staff as soon as possible to see what will happen.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"There is no good way to review this book without giving the plot away and all I can say is that this is a extremely complex book with lots of twists and turns. There where times I did go out to Google to research some of the mythology mentioned in the book to round out the reading for my self-need but it is not necessary for the reader to do that in order to enjoy this book.

The author creates a very interesting world involving mythology and a large variety of complex characters drawing the reader deep into her fantasy world. Readers will be curious with the plaything, Damon and his story while wondering who he really is. As the story unwinds who he is becomes clearer and you will have that ""AH HA"" moment and feel at peace with him and his story.

Meanwhile Elysia, another aspect of this story, continues to draw your attention in another direction worth investigating. Elysia is a great example of how a woman would handle life threatening situations when there is no choice but to live. Her believable character will draw the reader closer with the desire to see her succeed and get her hearts desires.

Secondary characters are numerous and the reader will be able to tell that their stories were written in previous books to this series but this will not be a problem to reading this book.

Evelyn was to be a Fox bride but she sabotaged herself by pretending to learn nothing and getting fat and failing interviews with prospective grooms. All she wanted was freedom.

It is NOT a rosy and warm story full of happy feel-good moments. It is a story filled with mistakes, regrets, deceit, danger, and betrayal.

We meet Harley when she is fresh out of prison. She just served three years for a crime she was set up for and unknowingly committed. She lost her dad while she was locked up, his battle with lung cancer finally over. She goes to the only place she has ever called home, the Inferno Glory MC clubhouse. When she gets there, the man who has always been another father figure to her turns his back on her. This is when she meets Colt. With no place to go she begrudgingly takes him up on his offer to crash at his place for a short while. It doesn't hurt that he is OFF THE CHARTS HAWT!!!!

Colt is instantly enamored with the vixen on two wheels and jumps at the chance to be her (paraphrasing book) knight in a leather cut riding in on his black hog to save her. The love/lust is kinda insta-lust that grows into some deep feelings fast and the sex is raunchy and will melt your undies right-off.

Despite the romantic aspect there is an undercurrent of subterfuge and suspense and the book ends on a cliffhanger in anticipation of the next book, Pleasure & Pain: Inferno Glory MC #2. I thoroughly enjoyed this quick read and can't wait to see what's going to happen next!",0

The characters were so",1
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.  Everybody else needs to start earlier in the series, if not at the beginning, and develop a love for this world in order to appreciate this story.",0
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I liked the story.  By now you know what the story is about so I won't go into that.  I thought the storyline was good.  I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.

She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.  Seems he was made to grovel and she was the one that ran rather than staying and discussing things with him.  But, this is one of those stories you need to read for yourself.

The lead female, Avery, is mostly strong and determined to make it on her own, if a bit naive when it comes to her ""best friend"". The lead male, Chase Winters. WOW!!!  He's the MMA heavyweight champion, capable of inflicting serious damage. His strength of character is as strong as his muscle. When Chase witnesses a heated discussion between Avery and another MMA fighter who wants to be more than friends and sees Avery get pushed against the concrete wall so hard you can hear her head hit it from over 10 feet away, Chase intervenes, telling the guy point blank YOU NEVER HIT A WOMAN. After the threat to Avery is removed, Chase watches over and tends to Avery, ensuring she gets the care she needs. Deciding this girl is the one for him, Chase proceeds to give his heart by absolutely cherishing Avery at every turn. He cares for her, he protects her, he respects her. This is a guy who knows how to be the alpha male without being over-the-top possessive and controlling. Chase Winters is all that and then some. It helps that Chase has a good friend watching his back (Dale) and a GREAT relationship with a TERRIFIC father.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is my first book by this author, so I didn't really know what to expect. I found the beginning of the story a little bit hard to get into - not because it was badly written, but because of the subject matter that it covers. Cassie, the heroine, suffers a traumatic event that will shape the rest of her life. How she deals with this affects not only herself but those around her. The event is not allowed to rest though, the perpetrator come back to haunt her.

Once the story moves into the present day, it became a wonderful, emotional and gripping story. One that certainly lives up to the term ""a real page turner"". Cassie meets her one and only love, her soul mate in Jordan - their story together is simply beautiful. But due to decisions she makes, Cassie loses eveything, causing not only her life to be affected, but Jordan's as well.

They say that separation makes the heart grow fonder - for Cassie this is so true. Jordan is never far from her mind or her heart. He loves her and he also has the ability to give her the strength that she needs. The heartbreak that this woman suffers is devastating, but it is one which gives her strength to deal with all adversity.

This story is amazing, an emotional rollercoaster that will draw you in. The characters that Krissy V has written were superb - they are one that will live in your heart and mind for a long time after the book is finished and put down.

A highly recommended read.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"A romantic mystery with a touch of suspense.

An Opportunity Seized caught my attention with its name. I immediately thought that this was a workplace/office mystery. After reading the book I am still not sure what the title has to do with the story.

Toni is an heiress, the daughter of a mining magnate, who just wants to be normal whereas Jason is ex-military and co-owner of Haven Security. Jason is the bodyguard hired by Tonis father.

While guarding her he develops feelings for her. She falls for him, too. A relationship that was almost impossible to begin with is tested when a mining accident threatens the whole family.

One thing I liked about the relationship was that though both of them were immensely attracted to each other, they also get to know each other on a deeper level than just chemistry. This part of their relationship is shown clearly after the mining accident.

Readers who enjoy frequent sex will be pleased with this short story. It wasn't the hard core erotic variety but there is enough to make a reader who isn't used to reading it to possibly become either uncomfortable or start blushing like crazy.

That being said this is still a mystery. I think the beginning was a little slower than the ending. The ending seemed a little fast paced, which I loved.

This is a romantic mystery, heavy on the sexual elements. It worked for me because there was enough of the mystery plot to offset some of the romance.

The ending was a full of surprises. The twists and turns and the new information that were revealed kept me reading to the very end.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This is the second book in Barbour's holiday series. Well-written plot with realistic characters that has no real connection to the Christmas holiday other than the setting. Deputy Shawna Mallory is a thirty-one year old single cop who lives in the rather sleepy town of Carlton Grove. She has a deep commitment to her job, and moves quickly when she hears an amber alert on the radio for a missing eleven year old boy. Mallory hears a dog barking; she finds the boy under a snow drift being guarded by the pup. The sheriff agrees to take the boy in while he awaits a new foster care family.

Complications arise when the boy's real father arrives back on the scene from an overseas assignment in Chile. John Reid McCrae appears to have a poor parenting track record, but Shawna's friend Alice knew him many years ago and offers a different opinion. In the meantime Shawna grows attached to Billy, who is about to be given to a new foster family. Billy runs away once again, but even more puzzling is the strange affect Billy's dad has upon Shawna. What outcome ensues for Billy, John, and the Deputy Sheriff whose lives have become entangled.

A heartwarming story revolving around coming of age, domestic violence, foster care, romance, pets and peer relationships that will tear at the heart strings of young adult and adult readers. Actually, the book could be a middle grade read if one is willing to look past a few curse words and one or two light romantic scenes.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I admit, that I was a little confused at first. The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.

Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.

They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.

One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.

This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.

Maybe that's a good thing....",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Going Against Type by Sharon Black (click here for Author Wednesday guest post) went toward my type of delightful light-hearted contemporary romance set in Dublin, Ireland. The genre hearkens back to the 1950s with mismatched lovers such as Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, albeit with Irish eyes and tastes.

Charlotte ""Charlie"" Regan yearns to find her place in a world dominated by men as a sports' reporter and columnist. The hero of the story also fights for his place in the world of fashion writing where men are in short supply. It doesn't help matters that they work for harshly competitive newspapers and somehow find themselves pitted against one another when Charlie steps into the world of fashion by criticizing the footballers of Ireland for advertising popular name brands.

The novel reverberates with authenticity of the life of a journalist always under pressure to be fast, accurate, and edgy. Ms. Black, herself a journalist, paints a realistic picture of both Charlie and Derry despite their opposite views. I liked the twist in the story that turned stereotypes on end. It reminded me a bit of the movie with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, You've Got Mail. For most of the novel, neither Charlie nor Derry know the other one is the author behind the viperous attacks in the two rival columns written anonymously. In the meantime, they begin dating, enjoying their time together more each time.

If you want to escape for a few hours into the world of Irish football, fashion, and foibles, you won't be disappointed with Going Against Type. I think it's the first Irish novel I've read that wasn't historical, which makes it both refreshing and light.",0

Michaela Western, is one of the very few women cruise directors around, and she intends to keep the respect she has earned the hard way. Until she sees Dylan, who makes her rethink a few things, but she has to be careful or she could be fired: on-board romances are frowned upon.

Ill put is simply: THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is excellent! Its so very well written; Ms. DeWintons prose is very expressive, flowing and so easy to read. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE really made me want to go on such a cruise: the author describes the ship and the setting  Australia and New Zealand  so well, I felt I was there. I also love how Ms. DeWinton portrays the dance environment and the performers; that was a lot of fun. Dylan and Michaela are both such fabulous characters. Michaela is very confident in her abilities, but she is almost all-business all the time; she cares almost too much about her job and she desperately tries to rein in her passionate nature. Dylan is seductive and charming, but not aggressive; still he decides Michaela will relax even if it kills him. The chemistry between Michaela and Dylan is sizzling and feels very real.

I love the playfulness and the interactions between Dylan and Michaela; Dylan is quite a wonderful hero and steps up when needed. THE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is a wonderful romance, sexy and yet very realistic as the romance progresses naturally. HE BOSS AND HER BILLIONAIRE is fresh, colourful, fun and very entertaining!",0

WOW!!!

I really enjoyed this book. It was not the best I've read in a while. There was a lot of action, and a little bit of romance in it. There was also some sex. There was also a bit of a cliff hanger, and I'm not sure if it was due to the ending or because I didn't want to put the book down.

I loved the main characters. They were very likable, and the sex scenes were hot. They were also a bit steamy.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This book had captured my attention as I had read one of her books from her series Love's Great Adventure and what appealed most was that this book was to be set in New Zealand and since I am from New Zealand, I enjoy books set here. The book starts over in America with Alicia discovering her cheating husband and then escaping over here to make a fresh start. She moves to Auckland where she has an IT job and moves next door to Tia, Hunter and Mick. What I liked about Alicia is that she is quite naive and this made her character funny and made her more relatable. As the book goes along we read as Hunter and Alicia start gaining great chemistry and though neither is officially ready for a relationship, they both seem to work great together and they get all hot and heavy. If you love Second Chance New Adult romances, then this is the book for you. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the language as being from New Zealand , I am used to how we do things here and our language. The author used phrases like Kia Ora as hello since the character next door was Maori and the word Pakeha and tribe. I know often it can be difficult for American writers to grasp the different cultural differences and language. Overall though it was only tiny things that unless you are from New Zealand, you wouldn't notice or pick up.  Honestly, if you are on the lookout for a lovely second chance at happiness and romance story then By My Side is the book for you.",0

Footsteps stomped with the force of a giant on the wooden steps. Pounding in synchronization with each ragged inhale Nikki took.
Dang it. The door. Just as she lunged forward to lock it, the handle turned. She jumped back. This is probably nothing, just an innocent mix up in dates. But then again She lifted the spoon over her head.

Womp! Not one to sport violent tendencies, she lowered the spoon with all the force of a pillow fight.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love. The characters are well-developed and likeable, the kind of people that you absolutely want to hang out with. Paula Altenburg has written a book that drew me in and kept me reading, and I look forward to reading more from her.",0

Overall, it was a good read and a short story. It was a good read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing. I don't think I've read a book that has a relationship between the two main characters, but I did find that I could relate to both of them. I was just not very happy with the way the book ended. It felt like the main character was trying to make her way back to her life, and the story ended abruptly. I was hoping that the author would have a more happy ending, but I didn't feel it.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This story, Unruly Hearts, really delivered the romance that I was looking for in spades. I found West simply irresistible, the combination of hot, handsome, well-intentioned neighbor struggling with awkwardly emerging lover along with a heroine who stars in this story for much more than her beauty was perfect. The love that grew between West and Annie reminded me of what my mother told me about love - when a man says he loves you when you look your best, it's a compliment, when he says it in the garden and you're covered in dirt, it's a declaration! In this story you also get a second romance, a mix-up on engagements, and a really nasty villain! Another thing I liked about this story was the strong female friendships that are too seldom found in literature. This story was well written and the story flowed well. The imagery was exceptionally well done; I could practically see, hear, smell, and especially taste the dust behind the cattle. The only false note in the story was Clara. I felt her hesitation about setting a wedding date didn't fit her character and her indecision about marrying West when she had feelings for Jones just plain felt wrong to me. That's why I gave this story four stars instead of five but even with this one flaw, it's still a very enjoyable romance with some graphic lovemaking but no vulgar language. (The reason I said ""lovemaking"" is there is nothing more than passionate kissing until West and Annie are engaged. ) For anyone looking for a historical western romance that makes you give a big smile at the HEA ending, then I definitely recommend this one.",0

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Sky High was a short and sweet read but it didn't exactly deliver all that I expected it to.

Some books that I have read make every character seem important no matter how trivial their role was, but this book wasn't one of them. While reading this book, a lot of times I thought that a character wasn't a significant part of the book and this didn't just happen during the book, It also happened after I had finished it. I kept thinking about the book and all of the characters inside it and they just didn't seem important enough even though I know they were.

What Im trying to say here is that, in my opinion, this book lacked some sort of execution or finesse that could have taken it from being just another good book to an amazing one. I never for one second doubt that C.J. Lake holds talent for story writing but all Im saying is that it needs a little bit more work.

Other than that, the story was sweet, romantic and also quite hot. Even though a lot of characters appeared to be minor, I did love the main characters and the chemistry between those two. The relationship between those two was something to envy. Their banter, their romance, their attraction toward one another was extremely enjoyable to read.

In the end, I wouldnt say that reading this book was a waste of my time but I also won't be reading it a second time. Nevertheless, I will be reading other works of C.J. Lake to look for better versions of Sky High. And when I read one like that, let me tell you well have a winner on our hands.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.

The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.

Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!

While I read the first two books, I didn't really care for the rest of the story. The first one was really good, but the second one was really bad. There was no real story to it.

I did get a little frustrated with the hero and heroine, but I didn't really care about them. I think that they were all just a bunch of idiots.

I really liked the hero, and I really liked the heroine. She was a strong heroine who had a lot of issues. She was a bit naive at the beginning, but she grew on me as the book progressed.

I really liked the villain, and he was a good guy. He was a bit of a jerk, but I didn't care about him.

I really liked the ending. I was hoping that there would be a sequel. It didn't really happen.

I did like the other characters, but I didn't like the ending. I would have liked to have had more characters.

I really liked the ending. It was a nice little surprise.

Overall, I was really impressed with this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story, with some twists and turns.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"After reading the first book in this series I was super excited to receive this advanced copy from Charlotte Raine.

The girl that was kidnapped in the first book is now back with her family and working in a The Charcoal grill.

Is she over her experience? Is she heck. Its left her with a few scars, emotional. There is a reference in there to a phrase, it is reflecting how a human can harbor a beast, a wolf, everyone has hidden nasty tendencies, well, this is what I took away from it.

The guy who own the Charcoal grill is a bit of a perv, he doesn't care who sees him watching dirty sexual video's on his PC, no matter who walks in. However, the other side of him makes advances to his staff. He justifies this because the small town doesn't have that many jobs, so who can leave? Who can complain? Who can afford to loose they're job?

She is safe though, as she has an important father!

We have a death of Zoe. Then we have a death of another girl, both deaths a carbon copy of each other although the time zone in between is distance.

Getting into the mind of a certain character in the book was weird, eerie and creepy.

I just don't want to give the game away in this book 2 as its so cleverly written and I don't believe in spoilers.

I have to say........the conclusion of this book has left it WIDE OPEN and its not the usual cliff hanger in a book, but it has its GASPING factor.

A really enjoyable read.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.

But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this ""useful"" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!

Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.

If you look at most of the 5 star reviews, you will see that they are nothing more than shameless self-promotions of books written by the reviewers.  That should tell you something.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Why I Picked It Up
By now you can deduce that I am interested in any book that involves musicians. So of course I had to pick this one up, especially considering the fact that it hinted at a best friends romance.

Plot

It was that and more. The story of Chloe and Noah was complicated to say the least and it hooked me in. Seeing their struggles, seeing the two of them fighting their attraction, and trying to live life in the spotlight kept me engaged from the very beginning.

Leading Lady

Chloe was a great character. She cared for Noah. She was excited to get a new start. She was happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex.

Leading Male

Noah was sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician characters in novels nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms.

Romance

I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship was fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more. And of course, I adored the fact that they were friends first and foremost. They were perfect for each other and complimented each other very well. I hope we see some of them in the companion novel.

Conclusion

Overall, Before He Was Famous was a great book about friends to lovers with a dash of famous musician: the perfect recipe for a great book.",0

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is the same story as Jag but from Roxy's POV. There is a lot that you learn about Roxy and why she is the way she is. It really awesome to see things from her POV which made for a more well rounded story. She really is a strong person and I really admire her.
Jag and Roxy are definitely a unique couple. They started out basically hating each other (or close to it) and it basically boiled down to several chance meetings where they poked at each other. This was extremely amusing to read about. Jag has serious drug problems and unfortunately a huge part of that is is rock career and the people in it that put a lot of pressure on him. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend from before he became famous. Roxy grew up with a drug dealer father and brother who OD'd so she's seen that side of things and wants nothing to do with it. She turns out to be Jag's saving grace and the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Despite all their personal problems, they truly are a fantastic couple.
I loved how raw and emotional the story line was. It felt like it could be one of those documentaries about a real life situation. I felt deeply invested with the characters and hoping for a good outcome. It's definitely not for those that like all the flowery words and a perfect story because it's far from that.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"In this book, David Birkenhead is still technically a rabbit, but he's now a free rabbit, no longer considered a slave by law.  But as he recovers from his injuries and considers his future, it's clear that most people still consider him to be a slave in all but paper.

As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.

So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.

So, I'm pretty jazzed about it, even with the bunny ears and slavery, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.",0

The character development was really good, nice little twist in there.....I TOTALLY LOVED IT!  Lance became my favorite when I read ""Mate for Gideon""...He called Sarah, Prim (Ms. Prim & Proper), next to my boy Zane..I mean vamp..Love Zane!  Talk about eating humble pie...I  don't want to give anything away but when I read about the door slamming in the face, I thought that was the ultimate.  Ah mannnn, I died laughing, it was GREAT!  KARMA is something!  I loved the fact that Charlene brought back previous mates, I wish there was a bit more conversation, but it was cool.  Brant, Zane, lil Sam and Tanya...Tanya still holding off on sex to get her way??  She's something.  I totally hope Charlene give us story on the Elf Prince..who was the vamp he fell in love with, Brant's secretary?? I'm dying to find out!  Can't wait for Titan to get a mate.

Looking forward to reading that....Keep these fun stories coming Charlene, they're great!",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Brothers are the authors of childrens books that are as entertaining (and of educational) for adults who read to their children as well!  This is a new series by The Brothers is a learning tool as well as an entertaining well illustrated with photographs book for youngsters who are curious. It is meant to be shared, a starting point for parent/child interaction in learning and opening the field for questions.

This book deals with the number 2  and to give an example of how the book is constructed, the first page starts with a photograph of adult hands holding baby feet. The wording is We have only two hands, two feet, two eyes, two ears
Did you know that? There are 27 bones in the human hand and that only apes hands have a similar structure. Picture, facts, and then further information make this a very interesting format.

Some of the other 2 pages present eyes, sets of teeth, genders (the note courageously mentions the combo  hermaphrodite), two names for autumn, two political parties, sides of a coin, two kinds of pandas, number of humps on a camel, the two World Wars, two million flowers for a bee to make one pound of honey, number of days humans can survive without drinking, number of muscles in a cats ear = thirty TWO, and so forth. The amount of information begins at an (hopefully) obvious level and then disseminates into all manner of topics as the above list suggests. As The Brothers say, Read it the book to your children, speak to them about it and explain it to them. This is one of the more creative and fun books for families. Highly Recommended.

The characters are well written and well developed. I would highly recommend this book. I really enjoyed this book. The first book was a great read. I read it in one sitting and couldn't put it down. I liked the characters, the story line, and the fact that they all had a very positive impact on the reader. I enjoyed the fact that the author does a great job with the language and the plot. I think it would be great if the story line would have been more developed. I am hoping that the author will take this author to the next level. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters. This is a very good story with good characters. I wish it had been longer. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more time to get into the characters. I love this series. I was waiting for the next book to come out. I love the characters and how the story unfolded. The ending was a bit abrupt. I don't think this is the end of this series. I liked this book a lot. I didn't like the whole relationship. I just didn't like how it ended. It was too short.

This is a good book for a romance novel.  I recommend it.I have a hard time putting down this book. I loved it. I loved the characters. I'm not sure how I feel about them now.

A lot of the characters in this story are good, but some of the secondary characters are just plain stupid and are not worth the time or effort.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I was given an ARC copy of this to read and review by the author, however I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy for myself.

This is book two in this new series by Georgette, however it can be read as a standalone. There are brief appearances from the first couple in the series so while it works on its own, I would suggest reading the first book anyway.

Cadence is half werewolf, half dragon. She never knew her father and was raised by her mother with no impact from her father or his family. Since her wolf was most dominant she was able to hide that she was half dragon, however she is changing. Her wolf is gone and her dragon side is beginning to take over. She is unable to hide it any longer and since dragon births are on the decline, she has no choice but to register and subject herself to a forced mating with a complete stranger. However fate was at work when her best friend, Daisy, happened to meet a dragon as he was being ejected by her aunts mating agency. Some quick thinking gets them both in the same room and that is where the real fun begins.

I love this world Georgette has created as well as the two sides to the dragons. The ice dragons and the fire dragons and the war that has always been simmering between them is so interesting. Cadence is an ice dragon and Orion is a fire dragon. They should hate each other, not be falling in love.

This one had action, forbidden romance and a lot of fun moments. One of Georgettes best books in my opinion and I definitely recommend to fans of paranormal romance.",0

Here I thought he was messing up one situation but so much more came with it. Brielle was wrong but it was nothing she could do to change the way things panned out. I liked Brandon and his boldness at dinner and that really had me cracking up. I was pissed about the lie he told at his office but I guess he was doing what he thought was best. Eliana seemed like a very sweet person and I hate how what she thought was something special was built from lies. Chelle and Meachy had me so confused but once I started understanding what was what it really threw me for a loop. Meachy's role wasn't excused but she didn't have to let everybody else's secrets out to save her own ass.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I love sports romance, but hockey romance is by far my favorite! I now have read all seven of these fabulous Carolina Cold Fury Hockey romances and I have loved them all for different reasons. They all have different types of twists to each of them. Now I have a new favorite, Roman! I loved it and flew through the pages!

I am not going to rehash the story for you as the synopsis gives you a good set up of what the book is about. There is drama. there are steamy love scenes between Lexi and Roman, but it is a slow build with lots of flirting and innuendos and they are so sweet together. It is wonderful to see how their growing infatuation turns into a deep caring relationship.

The new twist to this book is there is a concurrent love story developing between Brian Brannon (Lexis father that she recently found out about from her dying mother) and Lexis free spirited boss Georgia! Lets just say Georgia really knew how to loosen up that stuck-up suit! Another twist is the family dynamics between Brian, Lexi and her half-sister, Gray. Gray had a hard time adjusting to the idea of sharing her father (Brian). Gray, as general manager of the Cold Fury, had issues with Roman and his personal and professional trouble making ways. Roman didn't like her management style, so they agreed to disagree and their disdain for one another put Lexi in a bad position; choose between her new family or the man she was falling in love with.

If you love sports romance that has a bit of drama, fun banter, steamy scenes, touching moments, and crazy secondary characters, then give this book a try. You won't regret it!",0

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Bought by Nicolette Hugo

Designation: Standalone, 302 pages

Nicolette Hugo is a new author for me and she is one I will be looking for in the future.

The blurb is very accurate, but it really only tells part of the story.  We begin with Killian Bailey trying to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped by the cartel. He saves her, but not before she is permanently harmed.  Killian is also scarred by his failure and puts all his effort into getting revenge on the man who took her.

Although, Scarlet Bailey loves her husband she misses their intimacy since he is punishing himself for failing to protect her so she calls on Jerricho Black, Dom for hire.  Once Killian finds out, he hires Jerricho for 40 days.

So this is quite a complicated plot.  At times it seemed a bit choppy or maybe it was just because there were a few different stories going on.  I really enjoyed the dynamics between Scarlet, Jerricho and Killian.  Jerricho definitely had a complicated past and then the relationship between Scarlet and Killian was unique.  A few times I wanted them to just say what they wanted.  It was one of those books where no one was willing to admit what they wanted and they each thought that what they were doing was protecting the others. Overall we did get an HEA although not a full epilogue.  I still want more.maybe a book 2.

There was also the excerpt from Exhibition at the end which was very intriguing and is now cued on my Kindle.

I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street.

He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This is a sweet book about a loving married couple, Frank and Wendy, with three kids. They've been married over a decade and still love each other a lot, but over time the passion has faded in their sex lives.

Frank is busy with his job as an accountant. He is very methodical. He thinks things are fine between him and his wife, but mostly because he has stopped paying attention. He finds himself masturbating nearly every day, afraid of burdening his wife with his carnal needs.

Wendy is a stay at home mother of three rambunctious boys. She loves her husband, but finds that he no longer satisfies her in the bedroom. She has immersed herself in the erotic novels on her Kindle. The dominant book boyfriends provide her with plenty of masturbatory fantasies to get her through the day. Her BOB (battery operated boyfriend) is her best friend.

Things change when Frank accidentally takes his wife's Kindle to work with him by mistake. He discovers the erotic world that his wife has been visiting, and he realizes for the first time that things may not be as okay as he thought they were.

Frank, using his analytical accountant mind, begins to read, research and analyze the books his wife has been fascinated by. He learns all about BDSM, and dominant/submissive role play. He even joins Fetlife, an online message board for those in the lifestyle. He learns all he can, and he is determined to become the dominant man his wife needs him to be.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Lush Life is the 8th book in the Samantha Jamison Mystery series and although each book is a standalone they do somewhat follow from the last I'm lead to believe. This was my first taste of the book series and I'd quite like to read the others at some point. I was a little worried that I wouldn't get into it, but from the beginning you feel like you're part of the sleuth clan and not just the reader.

This book series is based around Samantha or Sam to her friends that is a mystery novelist that turns the crimes she solves, with the help of her friends, into novels. It all started when she didn't get the information she wanted on how her husband died so solved it with the help of a PI named Clay. The Lush Life sees herself being dropped in it when Clay agrees to house sit for a wealthy couple in New Hope they'd both met previously but he couldn't do it due to a prior engagement and so left the house in her capable hands.

As the story continues Sam finds that more and more interesting characters are turning up at the house, some supposedly working for the Worths and others supposedly sent by Clay. But something isn't quite right and so we find ourselves trying to help solve the ever evolving mystery. We are continuously left guessing who could be the culprit.

It really is a fun humorous mystery unlike some that's out there with a mix of other things too like romance, it's perfect for anyone. It keeps the readers interest to the last page making it hard to put down. There is no way you can guess who did it until you reach the final page.",0

I'm loving this boxset so far, it has some authors I already follow & some new authors being introduced to me. Once I have read a book within, I'll add my reveiw for it.

The Clockwork Dragon by Tasha Black....
I FLOVE Tasha's ""Curse of the Alpha"" & ""Fate of the Alpha"" series & to learn that 'The Clockwork Dragon' is set at Tarker's Hollow.... made me do the happy dance. I was instantly sucked back into the lives of the citizens of Tarkers Hollow & I LOVED it!! Although it's centered around the Magical side of the community of Tarker's Hollow & not the wolves, you still get a scense of being there again. I was LOST in this, the story was rivetting.

An Impossible Gift by Cristina Rayne....
Oh My Goodness! That was short, fast paced & downright AWESOME! This is the first time I've read about Vamps from Cristina, usually it's shifters, but damn this story was good. Fast paced, full of action, loads of background story (you need this, believe me), a hot sexy Vamp who doesn't sparkle, all wrapped into a story about healing.

Wish upon a Star by Elsa Jade....

I instantly hated the new partners because Remy was meant to be with Jamie. I pictured their demise in horrible, awful ways. My heart and head both hurt. I didn't want to like them. I refused. Then it happened. I actually fell in love with the new guys and couldn't see them being separated. Now I'm confused. This is book two of four. I have no idea where it will end, and believe me, I begged Ms. Harner to give me SOME clue, but she's remaining tight-lipped over the whole thing. So read this book, fall in love with some great characters, and delve into a mystery of sex, diamonds, and betrayal. I honestly didn't see this coming. My jaw dropped and I was screaming at my Nook (I do that on occasion, don't judge me!) Oh no the hell she didn't (again!). The author has said that this is going to be a four book series. I'm not sure how it's going to end, but I know that whatever path she takes, someone will be unhappy. I'm not sure who it will be, but I don't envy the author. She's remaining true to her characters and the vision she has laid out. I'm eager to see how it works out, even though I know it's going to cost me a piece of my heart when it's done.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:

1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.

2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.

3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.

4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations. Pecan Praline Caramel and Grandma Stella's Caramel would be great for the holiday season. The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.

5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?",0

For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story..",0

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The best part about the 3rd installment of the IMA series is that it looks like it's not going to be a trilogy! The ending definitely sets things up for a continuation and that means more of my favorite fictional couple!

Locked and Loaded picks up exactly where Armed & Dangerous left off; right in the middle of Michael and Christina's first fully consensual moment of intimacy. It's nice to see the development in their relationship. Christina is still growing into her sexuality and sorting out her feelings for Michael. Michael is feeling somewhat vulnerable having confessed his love and now believing that Christina ""has him right where she wants him"" which makes him somewhat defensive. Or as Christina describes him ""Michael was like a half-tamed dog, as likely to turn on you as he was to snuggle up against you and lick your face, and just as slow to trust"". Their relationship isn't easy, but it is realistic and the characterization as usual is spot on. It is gratifying to see the emotion and trust grow between them; and Michael's sharing of his sexual fetish says as much about their individual growth as it is simply. rather titillating. The story is equally divided between relationship building and plot, suspense and intrigue. Christina finds that her plan of joining the BN to be trained as a hacker doesn't work out exactly as she had anticipated; and Michael still has the IMA and the psychotically evil Callaghan to contend with. The story ends on a Happily for now note. My only complaint is that it was too short. I want more excitement, more intrigue, more wonderfully enjoyable dialogue and more realistically portrayed emotional growth from my 2 all time favorite characters. (More hot sex and detailed fetish exploration would not be remiss either.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Ive decided to retire to Marietta and get a permanent ringside seat to all the excitement that seems to grace this little enchanting town. Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.

The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.

Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?

Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.

Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Eve Fortescue is back in Bellefleur, Lousisanna in hopes to convince Brent Bellefleur, groom-to-be, that she is the one he should marry ~ not Honey Moreau.  As a guest of the upcoming nuptials, Eve also has the uncomfortable pleasure of attending the pre-wedding dinner being held at the Bellefleur Country Club.  Here is where Eve is going to strike while the iron is still hot.  As she enters the country club, she latches onto the first unpaired male she can find and requests him as her date.  And she walks right into the web of Brent's cousin, Rainer Delacroix.  He makes her an offer she doesn't refuse and her seduction of the groom-to-be takes a different turn in the road.

Eve Met Her Match has a wickedly seductive kissing scene that leaves the reader breathless right along with the characters involved.  There are also some very swoon-worthy actions that make reading this short novella quite enjoyable.  The descriptions of each scene were adequate and well-written.  They don't bog down the story with useless details or babble.

At first, there is a bit of disdain for Eve.  I mean, she's only coming to the wedding to try and steal the groom away from a woman Eve used to call her friend.  Many of the secondary characters (guests that also attend the pre-wedding dinner) have no trouble seeing through Eve's charade.  It's perfectly clear what Eve's intentions are that evening.  Fortunately, she lands in the lap of Rainer, who does a sexy wicked job of seducing Eve and getting her to open her eyes and really take a look around.

This novella is sweet, sexy, and wickedly fun.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Couldnt put this one down from start to finish! From page one Ms. Marcus kept me intrigued in this beautiful romance that was just fitting for two strong and independent characters. My favorite, though, just had to be Rory McRoy. He was just such a sweetheart of a guy! Theres nothing that he wouldnt do to protect and support his woman. And, Neve James has all that and more when it comes to her relationship with Rory. Yes, there were some pretty heavy misunderstandings between the two, but as they work them all out, just what exactly is their connection? What does a relationship with Rory really mean to Neve? And, is she in it for the long haul? In other words, can she trust him?

This starts off as a pen pal exchange of letters as Rory is overseas on military assignment. Their friendship develops into something more as the two correspond and then finally meet. But, when Rory is caught in what seems to be a lie while Neve jumps to the wrong conclusions, their relationship suffers until Rory helps Neve see the good in him and learns to trust him again. Ahhh, the romance, which is sweet and sensual. The drama, which is conflicting and emotional. The suspense, which brings truth and understanding when everything is now out in the open. Its a story that is tenderly touching when dealing with sad but yet truly genuine concerns. The dancer and the soldier  two people wanting to find that everlasting love that they can trust in. Whos to say that they didn't find it in each other? This one is worth taking a chance on!!! Ms. Marcus again writes romance at its finest...

It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself.
Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is. Giving Jordan the time she needs was prolly the biggest thing to help her over come her own demons.
The sex is soo shower worthy. (smiles) some had me even squirming. The first time they are together how he tells her to keep her eyes on him. He chased her shadows away. Opening her future and helping with her past, with patience and showing Jordon she isn't just a booty call.

This steady to fast paced plot keeps readers hovering on the edge of anticipation with suspense, action, drama and romance.  The author uses well written scenes and events to inspire vivid images that capture the imagination.  Tension building anticipation and curiosity draw the reader deeper into this world of magic and mayhem and the strong compelling characters are easily related and grab the readers attention from the very beginning.

The attraction between Cam and Marco radiates from every page and the sex scenes are hot and steamy, but its the relationship that has magic and sparks flying off the pages and the two argue and test each other with snarky and humorous dialogue as well as some fight scenes. The bad guys in this series really inspire outrage and anger, only thing is there are so many plots and conflicts going on, the reader not really sure which ones are the bad guys, which of course keeps things real interesting.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I've had this one on my TBR list for a while and when it went on sale for 99 cents it was time to one click and read. The free sample was intriguing and it made me really curious as to what happened that separated this sexy biker from his little girl and her mom. Fighting to Stay is a book about a woman who always runs away from trouble or anything uncomfortable in her life and while I understand her reasoning, I don't agree with her immature thought processes.
Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.

But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father. There's a lot to do in Butterfly Harbor and he's going to do his best to help the struggling town but he's going to need Holly's help...if she'll just forgive him.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for a honest review.

As American as apple pie! I have been getting into Sports romances here lately ever since I read Pucked By: Helena Hunting, while Rage does not have quite the comedic timing it is still an engrossing read. I love baseball, even grew up playing it myself with my friends so I have a soft spot for anything to do with the sport. AJ is the main character and while he's a bit of a hot head he's an awesome player both on the field and off if you catch my drift ;)

Until he hits the major leagues his temper has controlled his career but after a coach takes him under his wing and along the way he introduces  AJ to his granddaughter who is adorable! And leads to me changing my opinion of AJ, he's great with Clair and eventually meets her mother Addison. . . He makes a stellar first impression let me tell you! Acting like a Grade A . . . Well you know haha but he makes a huge turn around.

I really enjoyed this book, the characters were so well done and the author built up enough intrigue and tension between Addison and AJ that it made for a natural progression. Not like some where they meet and within the first couple of chapters they are falling into bed. I like that she was cautious of beginning a relationship because of Clair it made her a good momma which is one of my favorite character traits of hers. There are some twists and turns in this story that I didn't quite anticipate and that made me want to pick up everything Elizabeth writes from now on. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy sports romances!",0

Book title: Alpha Wolfs Pet 2, Kept
Page length: 171
Price at time: $2.99
Review:  I was first introduced to Eva Gordons work through her first book in this series, Alpha Wolfs Pet book 1, hidden. I loved book 1 and have been waiting for book 2. I read book two in one day. The characters and setting are well developed. You can visually see where things are taking place and why. This story will grab you right away and you will not want to put it down.  The story doesnt leave you with a cliffhanger, but leaves you wanting more. I will be looking forward to book three. (Please read book one first)

Overview: Mia has just with through a huge ordeal. She was exposed to the secret society of werewolfs. She now has to agree to sign a non-disclosure and have the option of being his pet girlfriend (since wolves cant marry humans). Knowing that she is hiding from the mob and Dominic has offered to keep her safe and love her, she decides to sign the contract. But soon realizes that she will be subjected to obey all wolf laws, which includes being submissive to the alpha and being low man on the totem pole with the other wolfs, and with the werewolf King coming soon for his dead sons body, she struggles more. Mia is whisked away so the werewolf King will not order Dominic to execute her. When the werewolf King comes, he is not happy about what has happened with his son, with Dominic and his pet, nor is he happy that Dominic has a Pet instead of a Mate. Will Dominic be able to help Mia and save her from the Russian mob and deal with the werewolf King?

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy.",0

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Choose Yourself & Love You More by Author Lucie Jones

If there is a genre of book that I can identify with...it is an inspirational one!  The Introduction to ""Choose Yourself & Love You More"" is excellent as it quickly addresses the real issue and the difficulties we encounter in learning to love ourselves. It also stresses the need for internal positive self-talk. For many people, it is not so simple to look in the mirror and love what they see and who they are. As stated by Author Lucie Jones, it is very true that ""learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all"".  I'll even go one step further...if you don't love yourself you will never learn to truly love others. Charity really does begin at home. Therefore, I totally agree with her suggestion to have a better look at ourselves and learn to truly value who we are...

From the very first page right to the last, I can clearly see what this talented author's goals are and why she decided to pen this little gem of a self-help booklet. To love ourselves is not a crime...it is a necessity in order to positively change our self-image and move forward. Yes...we all have flaws as mentioned, however, they should not decrease our self-worth and affect how we live our lives. As this motivational author stresses, the benefits of self-love will enhance our opportunities to have better relationships. If we stop beating ourselves up...we will attract people who add to our positive dynamic which will result in healthier relationships. Who could ask for anything more? Great suggestions are given to help us follow a new direction and turn our lives around. It is an excellent place to start!

Beau did not see the revenge coming but when it happened he was angry and wanted to find Lola.  He wanted to destroy her?  Lola played the final card which not only hurt Beau but herself as well.  While Lola has disappeared, Beau is intent on finding her.  He goes through all the motions of being angry, looking for revenge and ultimately looking at himself and realising the part he played in this game.  How shallow of a man he became because of his money.  He realises that he loves her and not because she turned him down but because she is his equal and she owns his soul.  Lola has hidden under the radar while doing a road trip.  The trip opened her eyes up to discover what her future may hold.  After looking back on everything that they had endured, she knows she still wants him.  With her unexpected news and the realisation that LA is home, she heads home.  Can Beau convince Lola that he wants her without the games?  Can Lola ever forgive him?  I must admit I was a bit disappointed in this book.  The story lacked a building climax and was lacking conflict. Nothing much happened and most of what did made reference to things that we had read in the previous books.  In my opinion, I felt like the author was struggling to conclude this book.  The ending was really a bit of blas and the dialogue was awkward.  The head hopping between the characters was confusing.  I was hoping for more of a dramatic ending.  Overall the series was good but I did feel a bit let down by the ending..

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Funny, but I don't recall the other book leaving out this much information, but then again it was this time last year that I was reading it so maybe my memory's not so fresh. This book is good, but one thing that threw me off was the passage of time; there was no indication of it. ""2 weeks later"" ""6 months later"" these are only 3 word phrases, it wouldn't take much to add them. But one minute it was Christmas, then after a separator in the middle of the page - which usually indicates a scene change - it's spring break, then next thing you know it's Thanksgiving. One of the reasons this is a problem is right before the page separator, Adam and JJ were saying they needed to discuss something important, and then after the separator, not only has it been discussed, but the process has been put in motion and they're almost completely done with it. No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?"" I was glad that they were able to help provide a safe place for Thad, but what happened when they went to talk to his parents? Was there no argument or backlash at all? No obstacles in their way? And how did they decide to get legal guardianship? And why was the situation with Andrea helping out Adam and JJ handled like it was no big deal, just every day happenstance? And what happened with Grace Griffin? And this may be minor, but how on Earth did Thad get a new love interest before Adam's brother, Matt? Too many questions.

Or, at least they are until some unnamed, faceless person decides to play with Nikki and Damien again, by emailing them pictures of Damien in the throes of passion with someone else. But this nameless, faceless faction doesn't stop there. This person then moves on to sending Jamie, Nikki's best friend, a video of her in the throes with her former neighbor Douglas, who, unbeknownst to all his many conquests, films their sexual escapades on his laptop. Clearly, his video bank had been breeched, because, as it has been stated many times, Douglas wouldn't be able to hack his way out of a paper bag, even with directions.
But this huge annoyance (which isn't solved, btw, which leads me to believe that there will be more Damien and Nikki), is overshadowed by the true heart of the story. Valentines Day. Ms. Kenner certainly has a way with writing romance, and I can only hope that my first Valentines Day as a married woman with a man who owns pretty much the entire world is as romantic as Nikki's was with Damien.
Their celebration starts a few days early with a scavenger hunt, taking Nikki back to all of the places she and Damien have been to and loved in the past. The end result is a three day weekend at a private resort in the Bahamas, before coming back home to a few more surprises.
Despite having a few guesses as to who is behind this blackmail scheme, this was a very, very romantic book. Heavy on the between the sheets (or lounge chair) action.

Kiera is an emotionally stunted woman. She doesn't seem to know her worth & impresses her skewed view on those closest to her. Her best friend Kevin is admittedly in love with her, but demonstrates a lot of hate for her as well. It's as if his devotion has been one sided for so long it's become bitter.

I simply loved the fact that Mike and Shy marriage is strong, Ms. Jada knows that Mike will not ever be hers so she can do what she does best and that is make money. Oh yes ....Wanda is back and Bobby is doing what he does best and that is being Bobby. I loved how this author was able to bring out all about Mike's father and family. Wow, how they were so alike in mores ways than one. Now, that will be interesting to see how this saga will turn out. The only thing left to say is that we the readers will be waiting waiting for the next great installment to the Mike Black Series.",0

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I thought I would give this author and series a go with this book.  I have to say I was surprised that my attention was caught from the get go.

It was very interesting to see how Dominic spent the last 200 years buried at sea.  When he was 'resurrected' he was thrown into the future and struggled to catch up.  His friend Palo took him in and began teaching Dom how to survive in the new world he found himself in.

A few thing bugged me about this story.  The grammatical errors.  When Dom accused Palo as a 'trader'.  I think the word should have been 'traitor'.  So little things like that distracted me from the story a bit.

The author glossed over the transition period for Dom.  I felt that the book could have been much more detailed and the author could have had fun with Dom's struggle with the 21st century.  I realise the focus for Dom is revenge, but the writing could have been meatier and richer if the story went into a little more depth.

The sex described seemed to skip a few steps.  I won't go into detail in case there are under 18's reading, but there was no writing direction, the reader has to assume what happens and where the positions of the characters are.  There were instances where I had to re read passages to see if I missed some things.

In the synopsis Dominic is intrigued by a lady biker.  The only lady he showed an interest in was a mechanical bull rider at a bar he nearly got tossed out of!  So I wonder where and whom this lady is , cause I didn't meet her!

But it was a good start and I am definitely curious enough to get the second book!",0

For years she had worked alongside her father to keep the ranch running smoothly and it has been her home and her life. She also discovers letters to her and her sisters from her late mother that bring news that change their worlds. While Callan fights to regain some amount of control over her life, Court lends his not only his supportive hands but also makes a proposal that could give Callan some resemblance of her old life.

I absolutely loved the characters, especially that of Callan and her sisters. They share such a cool bond and are really close and understanding. Callan emerges as this strong girl who is used to running a ranch and confident that she can continue to do so on her own after her fathers death. At the same time she has this feminine quality about her that is really attractive. Court on the other hand, at first at least, feels a little bit of an outsider. He is handsome and sexy and understanding. However, I really did not get their relationship. There wasn't much interaction between them, let alone courtship yet they end up in each others arm. For me it was like two strangers professing their love for each other.

The plot had some twists which were a welcome change from the usual romance novels. Courts background and Callans mothers letters provided some additional depth to the book. However, the letters written by Callans mother felt too clinical in nature and lacked the warmth of a mother. The letters read like appointment letters rather than a letter from a mother to her children, especially with the news it delivers, one would expect some emotional words.

C.J Carmichael is one of my favourite romance authors, but this book disappointed me a lot.",0

I liked the characters, but I didn't like the way the story ended. I wanted to know if it was okay with the author or not. I was a little disappointed that the ending ended, but not that I was expecting. I thought the author was a good writer, but not a great author. I liked the idea of the book, but didn't like it.I am always a little skeptical of how this book will play out in the future.  I loved it, but it took a little while to get into it.

I would recommend this book to others.  I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I liked this book so much I could not put it down! I love the characters and the story line! It's very realistic! I want to see more of the old school soldiers, but I'm not sure I want to read a story about a man who is so broken and confused that he doesn't know who to trust or care for. I love the fact that the author does not give the reader a definitive answer for what caused her to be so broken and confused. I look forward to reading more books by this author!

Having said that, and the fact that it was awhile ago that I read this, I really enjoyed the story. I had read some reviews voicing concerns about events taking place in the book, but considering the time these events took place (alternate reality, as it were,) this didn't bother me. I'm just reviewing this now, because I still remember things in the story; it's thread still excites me. I have it in my ""to read again pile,"" which says a lot. I will also say that even though this is a Book One in a trilogy, this book stands on its own nicely. In fact, I really have no desire to finished this trilogy. I previewed the other two books and they don't hook me like this first book did. Unlike other trilogies I've read, there is no cliffhanger, that I recall. Overall, a rather enjoyable, (albeit long,) story. I don't normally read nearly 600 page stories. Aside: I don't care one whit about this author's gender issues. misrepresentations or not. We all have our gender discoveries to make, many take a lifetime to resolve. Far be it from me to judge from afar without walking in someone else's shoes. I buy books that I like for content. I don't care if it's a ghostwriter, a straight man writing as a lesbian, a f2m, m2f, transgender. Or any other gender I missed. Reviews should be about books, and author's style; they should not be direct attacks on said author's person. And full disclosure: I was born a woman; and, yes, I am a lesbian. I do not read most books mainly for the sexy bits. I absolutely believe you can be straight and write good gay/lesbian dialog. Love and emotions are universal.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

Bring on the next enstallment!",0

But what we do have is a very well-written and engaging story about a young man's experiences as he becomes an intern at a large well-to-do church. In the hands of most writers I would have probably been bored to tears but Mr. Moody creates a fun and entertaining look into the quirks and idiosyncrasies of your standard Baptist style evangelical church. As one who has spent many years in ministry I can say he hit the nail on the head. No matter where you are or what you are doing people are a trip.

If you're the type that likes easy going stories with no stress or books that won't keep you up too late at night I suggest getting yourself a copy.

If you're concerned about the book being preachy because of the topic you have nothing to fear. There is very little Biblical reference at all. It's more about the people and the inner workings of ministry in general. You'll laugh and be entertained. Even non-believers will enjoy this book. It was a nice stressless experience for me and I enjoyed it much more then expected. It'll make a nice seashore read for a lazy vacation.

Libbie comes from one of the most wealthy families in the town. Her family or at least her mother places her value on wealth to measure worth. Her sister was someone I really disliked, she was a real stirrer of the pot. Libbie's dad was good, if somewhat indulgent and with the penchant to look for a life of turning a blind eye to what was going on in his home.

Jack was a hard working young man, in love with Libbie but as their life progressed he could see all was not right with Libbie. (They married so young - as  many did in those days.) So when Jack's daughter discovers that he was married before the marriage to her own mother she is very curious as to what happened to Libbie. As the reader I was too, what did she do in the intervening years? How did this fragile, anxious but sweet young woman fare?

It is Emily - Jack's daughter who when she learns of Libbie in her father's life spends time searching for her.  It is a time for her too to re-evaluate how her own life is panning out and whether  the man she is with, is right for her.

The story comes eventually to a heartwarming and moving conclusion. I was amused at how well all the threads of the story were detailed out in the epilogue. It is rare that that happens!

The story examines mental illness and the lack of understanding in the past that led to much suffering. It is a story of second chances and growing into a place of contentment and self fulfilment.",0
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I definitely had a love, hate relationship with this  book. When I began to read  the book I wasn't very impressed at all. I couldn't really figure out who was who and what the story was really about. So I decided that I needed to continue on in order  to give a fair review. I'm so glad I did. The author has written a very intricate mystery that  kept me guessing throughout the book. The action is explosive and at times very intense.

Jake is a former Marine who has  a keen sense of awareness of his surroundings. I thought his  character was good and had lots of depth. He is smart, decisive, alert and had great instincts. He has a new job as a photojournalist. While following someone he inadvertently stumbles upon an assassin  at large. The assassin does  not like lawyers .  Jake seems to get one step ahead and then takes two steps back in this lively story. Who is the assassin? Why are lawyers being targeted?

I thought the assassin  was a brilliant character because he was so unpredictable. He reminds me of a ticking time bomb. You never know when it will go off but you know when it does , chaos follows. I liked the multidimensional, quirky and very unnerving characteristics he had. What I really like was how the assassin even controlled the people who hired him. With cutting words he was in control and calculated his every move. He does some very ingenious things to divert the attention away from him and on to Jake. Will Jake be able to prove who the assassin is? I recommend this book to mystery lovers who like intrigue and characters that jump off the pages with intensity.

Kieran  has a heart of gold but was guarded from events in his past and did his best to keep his distance from Belle but they both just couldn't stay away from each other no matter how hard they tried to hate each other.
This book took you on a roller coaster of emotions and was hard to put down once you started.
Belle really surprised me with her strength and determination to keep the ones she loves safe and away from the nightmare of a life she has been brought up in.
Damian was amazing and I fell in love with him the moment he made his entrance known, he is strong, controlling but more than that he is someone that would die to keep his family safe and I would

With much effort Alana persuaded him that the source of the problems was the Hollow losing its magic. She told him that something was draining its magic and she was the only one who could fix it. But she was lying to Bryce. She needed Liz to help her because her powers had weakened. It wasn't easy to deal with Brandon, Liz mate. He was suspicious and harsh with Alana.

They would have to fight him because without the Hollows magic the Mitchells would die. In this third story we get to know all about the Mitchells curse. Why Alana cursed Bryce and his brothers as collateral damage? I was very curious about what happened ten years ago that split them apart. Alana cannot forget Bryce did to her and Bryce could not have the woman he wanted because what Alana did. Way to keep the mystery of the situation. The author kept me intrigued from the first book. The development of the story was very interesting with much suspense, drama, action, and sex. Touching the scenes between Alana and Liz. Much feelings in there. This was the best of the three books of the Mitchells brothers. I knew it would be juicy. Love this stories.

I will admit that I have been tempted to buy an online game publisher for a while and then wonder if I could take it as a personal investment.

I was quite surprised to see that the author is on a new series that involves a new character, Ms. Reeder, who is a former CIA operative, and who is also a journalist. There is a lot of depth and mystery that is evident from the characters' actions. It is interesting to see how Ms. Reeder, who has been in the military for a while, has become a journalist.

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"It was a case of All or Nothing for me. The crux of story sold me even though there were parts I did not like. An aptly named series, Wicked Games play out in this book for Jena. Unwittingly playing a game she has no idea she is a participant in, it appears that by the end of the game she could lose everything. Character and story issues left me with mixed emotions. I liked King, but I did not like his original game plan and I had a hard time reconciling the man who went into the game with eyes wide open to the probable repercussions of what he put in play with the man who fought for his woman at the end. We also got just enough info on King and Wick to know they are not good guys, but not enough to know what exactly it is they do. At times, their actions did not match their words and this disturbed me greatly. Jena came across as dumb as a box of rocks, dismissing what was happening around her by resorting to excuses and sticking her head in the sand. She evoked frustration and sympathy simultaneously, but it was her weakness that lost me in the end. Timeline issues unsettled me as well, as in when did King and Wick meet? Was it in when they were kids or in the military? It cant be both in my head, yet both were stated as facts. A proper back story on those two would have improved this book immensely, probably cleared that issue up and added some character depth that was missing. A little more about Jenas old job would have been nice too. And after all that you're wondering why I said I liked it? It was all about the game for me and on that level it delivered to the point of me wanting Wicks story next. Spices Rating: 3.",0

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"Anyone familiar with the Desire, Oklahoma series will recognize the cast of characters in this story -- including Dillon and Ryder. The newest addition to the town comes in the form of Alison (Ally as affectionately referred to by Ryder). Alison comes to Desire on the heels of a bad breakup from an abusive boyfriend. Similar to all the other stories in the series, Dillon and Ryder come swooping into her life completing ensconcing themselves in it while overwhelming her with their (neanderthalithic) overbearing ways and masculinity.

The story prattled along at a lumbering pace, IMHO, as Alison whined about things being ""none of your (Dillion and Ryder's) business"" (said 14 times) and spanking threats from the men (mentioned 33 times...yes...I counted). The story was highly repetitive...not only of itself but of the other stories in the series. Really the characters in these stories are interchangeable because the story lines are so consistent with one other. This series now has 8 books in it...and honestly, as a reader, I'm getting to the point where I don't care because there is nothing unique about them anymore. Desire for Three: Winning Back Jesse is actually about the characters in Desire for Three. *Scratches my head*....so now we're going back and revisiting characters? Pass!

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Leah Brooke's work, I just want to see some originality come into play in her stories. As they are now...they are just meh because of near exactness of the stories and characters -- resistant females...dominant men...and they all live happily ever after. I'd like to see her throw some different characters in a the mix. Send someone of a different nationality to Desire to find love. Send a couple looking to add to their triad.......give me something different to work with.

Raw Desire wasn't unenjoyable...I just though it could have been much better and different.

I remember reading Mine to Lose where we were introduced to Trey. After everything that happened, I was hoping that he had his own story. This did not disappoint!

Trey is hurting because the girl he wanted belonged to someone else. He throws all his attention into his work. His younger brother Jett is back and is working with him. He and Trey go to a bar and Trey ends up drinking (which he doesnt do) and spends an amazing night with a stranger. Fast forward later and Trey is trying to get this account for his company, so he has to spend a few days with the owner and basically has to prove why his company is better that the company he previously worked for. That company sends a person to represent them and come to find out, its the girl Trey had that night with, Faith. From there sparks fly and the back and forth between them as they are trying to win the account is so good! They have a love/hate relationship but the attraction is there. talk about hot!

As you get more into the story, we learn more about Faith and who she is. You just want to take the two of them and lock them up so they can get their stuff together, but there are things that prevent it. you will enjoy this story and root for Trey and Faith all the way! Do they get together after everything that's happened? You have to read it to find out. Let me just say that Trey's brother Jett, was hilarious throughout this whole book.

I have read some truly remarkable horrible stories based on facts over my time but this one is truly dark, full of mental and physical anguish, abuse and RAW emotions its tangible. You can feel it oozing out from its pages. I am taking deep breathes here. Its somewhat written as a memoir, but in other parts reads like a novel. Except for the fact this was reality for the author. There are advisory notes from the author:
If you yourself are disturbed by abuse and any of the violent abusive events in this story, she says, do not read unless you can survive it or it can lead YOU down a dark path:

If you have been abused, the same applies

Its interesting to me that she has not written this for a therapy as most do or a story to be told. The mental state and dark places this author went to in writing this book is deeper than a very deep black hole. She says how the book has not been edited and re edited so as to take the meaning and exact happenings out of this true story. It is how it is. The woman that is broken and quite frankly mentally disturbed [and who wouldn't be by this] is different from the woman today. This is not written as a memoir it is written more like a novel. Do not think you can read this book for enjoyment, definitely not. Its a journey, its a learning curve, its a lesson. Anyone can take something away from this read. There is no way I can say its NOT distressing because it IS. The author admits, she was insane when she wrote this, as an advocate for mental awareness, I would say, she definitely was emotionally distressed, disturbed and needed mental health care to cope. Whichever way she managed to get all those pieces back together, my hat goes off to her as it would have been oh so easy to have departed in other ways.",0

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I have a thing for time travel books. It started when I was a kid with A Wrinkle in Time and has continued throughout my adult life. I've read Outlander multiple times and practically hug it at night. I just find time travel love stories to unbearably romantic.

""Paradox Lost"" was a nicely done time travel story with some good romantic chemistry. I always enjoy Libby Drew's writing. She writes in a way that feels... easy. Her stories have a great flow to them and this one was no exception. I was hooked from the start and effortlessly got into the groove of the book.

I had a few problems with some of the finer details of the story. Reegan had a PhD in history and was supposed to know the time period of 2020 like the back of his hand. That is why it was irritating for me when he didn't know some pretty basic facts about the era that he was visiting. He kept trying to open things voice activation and bumbling through 21st century appliances. It felt odd to me that a time traveling historian wouldn't know when things were invented.

Also, I kept thinking that Reegan's speech would sound different from Saul's. If I think back over 100 years and I traveled to that era, I would stick out from the moment I opened my mouth. I kept waiting for them to comment on accent or speech usage or something like that.

I tend to think of all of these details when I read a time travel book and they become distracting for me when I find inconsistencies.

Despite my nit-picking, this book really did have a lot to offer. It had a decent amount of action, some nice sex scenes, and it kept my Kindle glued to my hand all day. A solid 3.5 star (aka between ""liked"" and ""really liked"") for me.

Stranded with the Scottish Earl is a sweet romance novella that has a handsome, Scottish lord and a stubborn English woman in it. It swept me away from the beginning and I really enjoyed it.

Miss Charlotte Warren is living the perfect life or at least she believes it is and she thought her father thought so too so shes a little surprised and hurt when she gets a letter from him telling her that he has found the perfect husband for her. In no way will she agree to marry this stranger!

Ewan Macrae, the Earl of Lyle is looking for a bride but he never thought that he would find her in a little village in the countryside but her father (who he met in London) made him curious enough to make Ewan decide to pay her a visit. But he never thought that a spring flood would leave them secluded from the outside world. Something that works in his favor because the woman that he meets isn't very welcoming. But he knows in his heart that shes the woman for him. So now he has a few days to convince Charlotte that marrying him wouldnt be a bad idea. That hes worth it and he will prove it in any way that he can.

I really loved the banter between Charlotte and Ewan and yes, everything did go fast but thats much in the case in novellas. And sometimes you just want that magic where one look makes someone fall in love. Where love is simple. No fear, no hesitation just the knowledge that that one person is the one for you.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I loved Desiree Holt's book, Joy Ride.  As a matter of fact, I can honestly say that Joy Ride turned me into a Rock Band Romance Junky.  With that in mind, I'm here to tell you that Aftershock, the sequel to Joy Ride, has more than satisfied my appetite for this sub-genre of romance.

Aftershock is a truly amazing read.  In my opinion this story is even better than Joy Ride.  You do get to catch up on what's happening with the hero and heroine of Joy Ride, Marc and Emma, as well as getting to know the other members of the band Lightnin' a bit better.  But you also get to meet Sydney Alexander, newly named promotions agent for the happening, new-on-the-scene band Lightnin' who is hot, sexy yet somewhat troubled by some past life experiences and the nasty, bitter aunt who raised her after the death of her parents.  You get to learn more about Rick Trajean, leader of the band, Lightnin' while savoring all the sweet, sexy details of how Syd and Rick fall for each other.  Then hold on to your hats because things get a little wild when the nasty villain enters the picture.  Let me tell you.  Desiree Holt writes THE BEST villains and she sure doesn't disappoint in this story.  You are going to love hating this villain.

Desiree Holt is one of my absolute favorite authors.  I love her writing style.  Her characters are always so real.  The story line is always sure, succinct and sure to grab your attention.  All this is true in Aftershock but she goes beyond the usual.  I felt like I was really backstage listening to Lightnin' perform during the concert and interacting with everyone after the concert while reading this book. I highly recommend this book for your reading pleasure.  Aftershock is most definitely an Off-the-Charts #1 winner!",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"The Wedding Trap hit a bunch of sweet spots for me. It had a little suspense, a little steam, a heroine that was likable and it had humor. I love when a story makes me chuckle. There's nothing too slap-stick about the humor; it's mostly dry observations that the heroine makes about the absurdity of the situation in which she finds herself.

When attendees of Isobel's wedding aren't swallowing that Alex is Beth's boyfriend ""Charlie"", the rumors start swirling, much to Beth's mortification, that ""Charlie"" is really a gigolo she has hired to save face. Since Beth can't tell the truth about Alex being a CIA agent on a case, she has to roll with it.

EXCERPT:  ""Alex grinned. ""They all think I'm a prostitute, don't they?""

""Yep,"" she said. For some reason, Alex finding humor in the situation only darkened her mood further. It wasn't funny-it was disastrous. Spencer had gotten exactly what he wanted: she was a joke.

Given what had happened to her today, it shouldn't have mattered. But for some reason, it cut deep. She imagined what the epitaph on her gravestone would read.

Beth Bradley.

Liar. Sinner. John. ""

There were maybe some unrealistic moments in the plot as far as the CIA procedures go, but I don't know how they roll, so I don't really care. And this story takes place over the course of about 3 days or so and that's a short time to fall in love. But, again, I'm not reading romance for the realism. I would have liked an epilogue to find out how they settled into coupledom (I'm making up my own words, here). But there are two more books in the series and hopefully Beth and Alex will be mentioned so we can know how they fare.

This book is written in the 3rd person with both heroine and hero perspectives, it's unequal--there's more heroine than hero. I'd rate the steam at PG-13. There's a few scenes, but they aren't very explicit.",0

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"For many years now, I've been a fan of the true crime genre; reading nothing but these nonfiction tales of the worst side of mankind. After a while, while still interested in the crimes, the forensics, and the inner workings of the justice system, a reader can easily reach a point where the crime in and of itself has no shock value.

That was not the case in my most recently read book: Pure Murder by Corey Mitchell.

In Pure Murder, Mitchell tells the gut-wrenching, absolutely sickening tale surrounding the deaths of two Houston, Texas teenager girls: Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena.

On what should have been a short walk home through on of Houston's city parks, these young girls had the bad fortune of meeting up with six of Texas' teenage lowlifes: Efrain Perez, Raul Villarreal, Peter Cantu, Joe Medellin, Venancio ""Yuni"" Medellin, Jr., and Sean O'Brien.

Simply because the young, innocent girls were in the wrong place at the wrong time when these scumbags were ""feeling their oats,"" they were tortured, raped, and murdered.

For the first time in a while, this true crime piece managed to enrage me as I could not hardly fantom that in a group of six people there was not one decent individual that could have, in some way, helped these young victims.

And, as an added bonus, especially in a time where illegal immigration is such a hot topic, the attempts by Joe Medellin to use his illegal immigrant status as a means to absolve the indictment against him was, to say the least, infuriating. He participates in the raping, mutilating and murder of two young girls and he expects that this country will allow him freedom on a technicality?! I could not even begin to understand the audacity of this pathetic, spineless child killer.

If you're up for a good read that evokes so many emotions you feel as though you are on an emotional rollercoaster, look no further than this newest release from Corey Mitchell.",0

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

*dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time.",0

Jet is the real drive behind The Screaming Tuesdays, the real master of their music.  All the Tuesdays are talented in their own right, but Jet is the total package, even though his voice is his instrument on stage, he can play all instruments well (though he demurs about bagpipes).  He is obsessive about his notebook, where he keeps his works-in-progress, his thoughts and his secrets.  He has been wanting to get his hands (mouth, body) on Charlie since he first saw her on the first day of the US tour.

Charlie has been embedded with The Screaming Tuesdays since the beginning of the US tour.  A reporter looking for the in-depth true story about the band, the tour and the individual Tuesdays; she has kept her distance from all the members of the band and their support team.  She wants nothing to tarnish her reputation as a reporter and devalue her work.  She knows how quickly her reputation can be lost if she is linked to anyone she interviews.  She has been painfully aware of Jet from the first moment and has delayed his interview until the last.

The last day of the tour, the last night, after the last concert, Charlie is scheduled to do her in-depth interview with Jet.  Jet made a decision to avoid alcohol for the US tour; he states hes not an alcoholic and it is just a personal choice.  The Tuesdays have been betting against him, but the US tour is over and the betting pool is unclaimed.  Yanis brings Charlie to Jets suite just as hes about to shower off after the performance.  Jet doesnt want to do the interview with Charlie because hes unsure he can keep his hands off her.  Chicago is about to get hot!",0

The whole town seemed to be pretty much excited except her. Her heart has been broken by her high school sweetheart, a relationship that ended in a disaster. The last thing she needs was to become star struck.

Until she crossed path with the sexy and charming Greg Moran who arrives in Dogwood together with the rest of the cast and crew of Bittersweet. They had this crazy connection together, but if Cathy was careful to get her emotions in tangle, Greg can be pretty much fickle minded. He can be all in, and then all of a sudden, he was nowhere in sight. He can be interested now, and then appear disinterested the next time. He had some secrets of his own, that I wanted to know. I would have loved it more if he gets his own POV. But I was stuck with Cathy, and her thoughts weren't that bad. There were a lot of bumps before their happy ever after  and there were times when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really wants Cathy, or if both of them wanted this to work

There were times when I got frustrated with the hot-then-cold Greg  just about everything seems to be perfect, suddenly theyd be back to square one, but still I found this book romantic and endearing. I love Cathy, and her friend Max and Hal  they were a great bunch, and both of her friends are there to catch her every time she falls. Greg was hard to love, but you couldn't resist his charms, so please don't blame Cathy.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Following in the footsteps of the first book in the series, Marine for Hire, this delightful story treats us to Mac and Kelli. Mac is a security expert, ex-military, who needs a fiancee quickly as cover in his negotiations for an arms deal that is about to go down. Kelli is his sister's best friend, someone he vaguely remembers as a cute pig-tailed girl, but who will do in a pinch. Imagine his surprise when this vivacious gorgeous woman (who unbeknownst to him has had a crush on him for years) shows up for duty. The question is whether Mac will let the temporary arrangement they have turn into something more. I loved this story! Kelli is such a fun character - feisty, flirty, full of life. She has loved Mac from afar for so long, and now has the perfect opportunity to seduce him into bed and hopefully ingrain herself a little bit into his heart. Mac is also wonderfully written as a strong, handsome confident man, stoic on the outside but holding in strong passions on the inside. He feels that it's his duty to protect those around him and getting involved with a woman is too distracting. But Kelli is such a delicious distraction that he is willing to let down his guard just a little - long enough for her to get into his bed, and maybe a little corner of his heart as well. The sexual attraction between them sizzles and the love scenes are steamy and well written. Along with the relationship plot however is some suspense and action as well as Mac's job takes them into dangerous territory. In addition moments of humour abound, making the reader laugh out loud many times at the crazy antics that ensue. Secondary characters play important roles in the plot as well, mostly Mac's family as the relationship between Mac and Kelli develops. This was a fun, steamy, heartwarming read with laughs, tears and all emotions in between.",0

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I received ""Whither Thou Goest, I will Go"" by Naomi Dathan for free from [...]  I picked this book for one reason:  some of it takes place in Kansas.  Since I am from Kansas, I usually read books with Kansas as the location since most authors do not find Kansas interesting enough to write about.  This is an incredibly good book.  I loved this.  It starts in St. Paul shortly after the Civil War with Seth, an army officer, and Jem, a spoiled daddy's girl.  Daddy calls all the shots in this marriage, including how to raise Charley, Jem and Seth's son.  He bought their house, gives Jem an allowance, hires their help, everything.  When her father gets caught with his hands in the Army's cookie jar, Seth and Jem must sell the house and move.  Seth decides they are going to Kansas.  He actually winds up in Nebraska because the house is across the state line.  They move and start a new life.  One that Seth thinks he will control and start to call the shots.  God has other plans.

Jem is a wonderful fictional character.  She is soooo dramatic and funny.  She cracks me up even when she is being horrible.  Against her will, she toughens up and matures into a valuable woman.  Her character alone is reason enough to hope for this book to be a series. The end will stun you.  The only thing I did not like was the format.  I hadn't read carefully enough to see that the format was for an i-pad.  I have a kindle.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!",0

I was so frustrated because it ended as a cliffhanger ..and if I have never said it enough times ..Smiling)...I truly DISLIKE cliffhangers... Having said that Ms Devereaux was kind enough to send me book 2 for a free read and review as I did the first book ..Book 2 ......IS AWESOME,Exciting,Raptourous(sp?) ... OH I could go on and on ...  but seriously book 2 really gets into the ""nitty gritty"" of the storyline ..guess you could say the bones of who Sophie and Marc really are .... and what transpires between them and the other characters of their lives...Her writing is beautifully and wonderfully done... Sophie and Marc's characters are so developed in this book that you understand them far better ..The plot holds you from page one ..just as in book 1 you have the suspense , mystery and a glimpse into some BDSM ...even tho the sex scenes were more detailed in my opinion they were still not Explicit sexual content.....but they were good :)
I only have a slight sign of negativity and it starts around chptr 12 / 13 and goes on for a few chptrs ..you kinda get aggravated at the wishy washy ways between the 2 characters and makes ya want to reach in the book and slap Sophie into Submission  yourself..but.
 Ms Devereaux  comes back with a kicker..
Even tho Sophie and Marc's story is still unfinished ..... book 3 & 4 of this series jumps into a completely  new set  of characters.from what I have been led to believe in reading the reviews of them I myself have not read them ...
For me this book ranks 5 stars and book 1 would have been 5 stars but I was frustrated at the ending cliffhanger ... this one wasn't quite so bad ...but alas you still have a cliffhanger at the end...

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"This book is basically a continuous of book one. It pretty much picks up where book one ended. The only difference is there is more of Bran And Tyrone's point of view through out this book along with Lance and Tide.

In this book I was able to see that Lance and Tide where able to feel more comfortable in their relationship. I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and less based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice parts of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that passes Lance was more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feels like he has the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desires because Tide supports him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion.

Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's wants and needs but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional needs any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way.

Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make changes and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future books in this series.

I cannot wait till the next one comes out if their is a next one that is. I enjoyed getting to know these two couples and hope to read more about them in the future.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Wow, this is one very intense read! I was so blown away by the emotional pull in this book. I have read other books that Alice has co-authored with and have always loved her work. I have to say I think she outdid herself on this one. So many times I didn't know if I wanted to laugh, cry or just slam the book down and run. When you meet Saga she is just skimming by. Shes worried about making rent and having food to eat. Doing her best to hold on to a job that is not enough to get ahead. When she is at her lowest point, so she thinks things went south in a hurry. When there is no other option she takes a job as an escort. This is where she comes to know Jackson Stone. He is a very rich man who is looking for someone different from who is usually spent his time with. He goes to his long time friend Victoria who runs an escort service. Victoria sends Saga (Meadow) to Jackson knowing she is just what Jackson wanted except for a few overlooked details. Saga tells her self after meeting Jackson that she will not fall for the attraction she feels for Jackson. He is just a job. Jackson pushes his attraction for Saga away by telling his self that she is just a warm body to enjoy when he feels the need to. You are going to want to bash these two heads in at times. At times you're going to love Jackson how caring he is but then he turns and says or does something that you just want to slap him for. Saga is strong, but like all women she has a breaking point and Jackson seems to find just the right buttons to push to break her when he feels like she is getting too close. These two draw you in and keep you wanting more. Im looking and hoping for more from these two.",0

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story.

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Gideon Affair

Gideon Shaw is the sexiest man in Hollywood,  every man wants to be him and every woman wants to do him.  He has a very successful career with endless opportunities but the only things that mean the world to him are his family and his best friend and personal assistant Paige Turner.  He has loved her for as long as he's known her but he can't cross that line.  He can't risk losing her friendship if anything goes wrong.  And let's face it, he's an actor in Hollywood, plenty can and will go wrong.

Paige Turner is a Cornell University graduate that could do anything she desires in the business world.  When she came to L.A., the last thing she would have imagined doing was working as a PA for an actor.  But this actor wasn't just anyone.  In fact, Paige had almost single handedly invented this persona and without her, Gideon Shaw would not be the box office phenomena he is today without her.  She loves him but she can't let him know.  She values her friendship too much to even think about allowing him to learn her true feelings about him.

And then fate stepped in and threw them both for a loop.  They had to decide if the disasters that can only happen in Hollywood would destroy them or if they would come together and find a way to turn their friendship into something so much more than either of them was willing to admit could be possible.

Suzanne Halliday's story takes you through the challenges of a young couple that share love for one another but do not know how to tell each other how they feel without losing what they have and each other.  You will see how sex, drugs and the debauchery of Hollywood can affect a blooming relationship.  You will feel a variety of emotions reading this story but I promise you, you will enjoy every minute of it!",0

Kindle_Store_5,2,OR,"I am assuming that if you are reading this review you have at least read the synopsis of the book and know what the story is about so instead of summarizing I am going to list the things I did and did not like.

The good:

-The characters are great. They are charming and funny and I love that they focus so much on  family obligation

-The authors paint a wonderful picture of small town life

-There is a mixture of humor and more serious things going on within the story.

The not so good:

-There are a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes. A lot of mixed up he/she. There were also times that words were used in an unrealistic way. I don't think any woman has ever thought that she would like to feel a mans cock against her integument, though that is just my opinion.

-There was tons of unnecessary details given. I don't need to know that he turned the shower on, then checked the temp, then got in, then picked out a shampoo, then picked out a body wash and on and on it goes. The story could have been cut in half without losing anything of importance.

-pov jumped around a lot which is usually good but there was no real flow to it.

-There was just too much going on. The focus should have been primarily on Quinn and Mhisery with Chance getting his own book. The little glimpses of other people seemed out of place as well.

-It often felt like rather than reading a story things were being ""explained"" and there was too much repetition and even some inconsistency. He goes down on her at one point and then later is surprised that she is pierced there?

All of these distractions led to me not being able to enjoy the story even though I really wanted to, especially as this book was given to me in exchange for an honest review. I would really like to try another book by these authors though because there were things I really enjoyed.",0
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!
  Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.
  Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.
  One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.
  Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.
  After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.
  The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!

Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book",0

At times this book brought me to my knees because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.

Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?

Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book.",0

I loved the added mythology angle that was backed up by real sites. The science angle was believable and a the human experimentation added to the spine tingling parts. The action starts with the first page and you hardly have time to breath between pages. Robinson takes the reader on a rocket ride of adventure, treachery, treason and death. Each of his characters has special talents. Melding them into a fighting team is King's (Jack) job. In this story you get a lot of background about each team member. How and why the ""Chess Team"" was formed. Why Jack chose each name. Where Stan got his Desert Eagles. The first time Jack and Zelda met and what happened. How he won her respect and the rest of the teams. The bonds they formed with each other to become the fighting unit they are. Their first mission is to rescue a scientist who can translate an ancient manuscript. She has been kidnapped by unknown persons. The Chess Team follows the bad guys from Afghanistan to Iran and finally to France. They fight the Chinese tong, mutated humans, and unspeakable horrors. Finally in France they face the end of all life and maybe, the end of the planet. This is my first book by Robinson but not my last. I have already got his other Chess Team books on my ""to get"" list. I wish they were all audio books narrated by Jeffery Kafer. He has a very pleasing voice and gives life to the characters. He gets the dialogue between the team just perfect. Sometimes too perfect. LOL. The production of the audio was perfect. No static, dead spots, or skips. Everything was professional and well recorded. If you have read any of Jeremy Robinson Chess Team books you HAVE to read this one. The start of it all. Audiobook provided for review by the narrator.

I don't know of any other author who can lay a character open with such understanding and yet do it with humor and compassion.  She is one of my top five authors, in part for that reason. I highly recommend this book and the series, which can standalone individually, as well as from it's companion Afotama Legacy series.

Arnold has only been in Norseton a few days when he has a vision that takes him to the Roosevelt Forest in Colorado. He has seen a she wolf and her baby and all he knows about them is that the goddess wants him there to meet them. When he arrives, he sees the woman shift into her wolf form, leaving the infant unprotected.
Leonora was recently bitten by her mate and is forced to shift with the full moon, requiring her to leave Kinzey alone in the forest. She's on the run from a culture that denigrates women and an abusive relationship where she is seen as a possession rather than a person. She made her decision to run and having no support system is a consequence of that choice. But she has very strong protective instincts for her daughter and when she returns to her human form to find a strange alpha male wolf shifter cuddling an unusually calm Kinzey, she's enraged. He refuses to hand Kinzey over, though, and she soon finds they are headed to Arizona, to a pack he says is different. How can she believe him, when what he says goes against everything she's ever experienced?  Especially when he bites her while they are in wolf form and neither of them remember anything from that run. He promised her she would have choices at Norseton. But  the first thing he did was to take them away.

She's got fiery red hair and when she gets emotional there are flames she can't control. She was kicked out of school because of a fire she started and is now living with her grandmother, who works on a large estate. Being there brings Kia more questions than answers. She finds out the hard way that the surrounding forest isn't safe. There are creatures she's never seen and they aren't very friendly.

Ethan is used to everything that lurks in the shadows. He knows a lot of terrible secrets and is carrying a heavy burden. He likes Kia from the start, but he knows she isn't safe at the estate. He keeps his distance, but Kia is too smart for him to continue hiding things. He's afraid of what will happen if she finds out the truth, there are sanctions Ethan wouldn't wish on anyone, especially Kia. Will he be able to protect her and does she actually need to be protected?

Red is a great story about an interesting house with a fascinating forest. I loved reading about each creepy creature and like Alyxandra Harvey's vivid imagination. Her main characters are easy to love, which automatically meant I loved the story. Kia is fierce and fabulous and Ethan is responsible and brave. They are opposites who complement each other. Therefore they are a good match and I enjoyed reading about their numerous adventures.

I loved the fact that Kia has fire. It was fun to read about her abilities. She's passionate and the fire shines through in everything she does and it's the base of her personality, which is something that made me smile. Alyxandra Harvey's vivid descriptions of the forest and everything that's lurking there are fabulous. I loved her colorful and creepy monsters and the fact that the story is mostly about what it's like to be both the hunter and the prey.

Bianca is the young and beautiful dancer who works at the Grand. While working there , she sees a handsome bouncer, whose name is West. She really likes West and would love to get to know him better but thinks she is beneath him, that she is no good for him
One day her mom shows up and tells her that her dad is in trouble, the mob is after him and they needs a lot of $$$$$$ to get him out of it or things will get real bad, real soon. Bianca decides she has no choice but to rob the Grand. Its not like, as she sees it, shes rolling in the money. West, whom she has been slowly talking to, sees she is in trouble and wants to help but knows she won't say a word, keeps wait, watches and hopes she will say something. The attraction, the chemistry between these two are some explosive and electric. Will they or won't they is the question. And will West still want Bianca when all is said and done. Their love story is so beautiful and so full of emotion. There is a lot of pain built into this story. And there is darkness in this story. I loved reading it, feeling it as I read and it kept me on my toes which is Im sure what the characters felt. We see and can feel the human frailties in this story and also can feel the pain yet the hope and that is something Skye Warren does really well. I love how West wants to protect Bianca and does this sweet , alpha man act really well and oh my gawd, it did it soooooooooo well. I want a man like this. Bianca was so worried she would lose him but the ending will show us the HEA. I cannot wait for the next book in the series!

Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.

Lacey Weston had her reasons for wanting to leave Brisbane where she was attending design school and go back home to Jumbuck Springs.  But when she got home, her brothers wanted her to turn around and go right back.

Cooper Grainger used to be Lacey's bother Ethan's partner and he was asked to keep an eye on Lacey while she was away from home and in school.  She might need someone's help and her brothers wouldn't be there for her.  When Lacey comes to him the night after she breaks up with her boyfriend and says she wants to go home, Coop takes her.

Coop didn't plan on getting caught up in the middle of a family mess, but when he saw them gang up on Lacey, he had to step in.  Lacey had lied about being pregnant so her brothers would let her stay home. When they demanded to know who the father was, Coop said it was him to put an end to the discussion and so they would leave Lacey alone.

Lacey quickly becomes popular in her home town after she reconstructs a damaged wedding gown for a friend and the story makes it in a magazine.  When dream job is presented to Lacey, she can't say no, even if it means leaving her home town and Coop behind and moving to Melbourne.  She has to tell her brothers the truth about not being pregnant so she can take on this new job.  But what will happen to the relationship Lacey and Coop have started during the time they have been living together?

Sometimes you have to let go of who you love so they can be all they are meant to be.

This steamy story is one not to be missed.  Lacey and Coop were meant to be together even though Coop was a lot older than Lacey.  The passion they shared was intense. I can't wait to read the next books in this series.",0

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"The book for review is Legacy of Fear by Ryshia Kennie. It falls in the genre of mystery with romance tossed in.

The setting is Honk King. Andra, a young woman who now lives here gets the shock of her life when she finds her neighbor across the hall dead. Did they mean to get Andra?

Arriving on the seen is Max, a linguist who is trying to solve a puzzle that has landed in his lap in the form of a doll with the message, Find my heart. Find my girl. Why is he set to locate Andra? He needs her to crack the code of the message and the reason why it was set to him.

This starts off the pair in finding a mythical village that is run by and populated strictly by women. They need to learn a lost language to solve this mystery. Toss in men who are after you at ever turn, the plight of our characters just intensifies.

I do have one part of the book that left me flat. This is not a big book. I get the fact that Max and Andra who start off as friends start to like each other to where they get romantic. While I am not someone who likes reading romance in a book, if it is done in the right amount I am okay with this. The amount of scenes where we saw these characters expressing their feelings for each other and their interludes to me was too much and less would have been just as effective and the point would have been made just as well. I wanted to get on to the mystery and not turn a page and yet again see them being lovey toward each other.

This was a quick read, and you could easily read it in a short time. I loved the story line of the village, language and how it was all tied into a doll that was delivered to Max. That really was fun to read. Overall, this is a good read and for the price you truly cant go wrong.",0
