It was like being at the library and while trying to read a few chapters you were constantly being interrupted by a chatty Cathy. ugh!!  So, with that being said I did read this novella twice, the first time it was every page and I was extremely annoyed and wanted my money back. Then I re-read the few pages that are actually devoted to the main characters and it was enjoyable, but that being said it only took me less than two 1/2 hours to read this twice. Definitely not worth $2.",0

It is a great story with a mix of romance, of what might have been, what could never be, and the regrets we all carry with us through life.  It is about how life changes you and sometimes takes you on a path you may not want to be on, but nevertheless, there you are.

The heart of the story is Nella's love for a young man which she carries all through her life, and can never seem to come to terms with.

I enjoyed the way each of the Sparrow women made a contribution to their bloodline.

Books_5,5,OR,"I've really enjoyed this series and feel this book is the best so far. Relationship issues between the main characters (Ivy, Rachel, Jenks, etc. ) are becoming more complex and less confusing. The author has really hit her stride in bringing all of these characters to life. The plot was fast-paced, resulting in me staying up way too late to finish it. Although the main character, Rachel, is getting stronger, she still has flaws and makes mistakes - keeping her real. The only (mild) criticism that comes to mind is the continued Ivy/Rachel angst. It hasn't hit overload yet, but I fear it might if it continues throughout the series. Overall, this was a great 5-star read for me.",0

I am giving this book 5 stars, the characters were very developed and I felt like I could easily visualize them and they weren't unrealistic. The story itself is good with lots of turns and I was left guessing MANY times. This was not a predictable mystery which I really liked and which made me keep wanting to read to know what happened. I felt it did have a couple dry parts or parts that SEEMED repetitive, but those parts were quickly redeemed. I would highly recommend this book.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"Another great BDB book.  What I love about JR Ward is the fact that she introduces these main characters in earlier books so when the book finally comes up for them, they are already pretty developed and then you pop right into the story.  the way she twists it around and brings in stories on existing Brothers is also great.  Some series books will have the main characters and then you never see them again.  Not so with this series.  I keep thinking where is she going to go with this now, and she keeps surprising us.  Great read but you need to have read the priors to understand what is going on.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I have recently bought this book along with a couple of Osprey on British and French infantry tactics during Napoleonic wars.

Put it very briefly, get this book instead of the Ospreys. It covers not only infantry, cavalry, artillery but also naval warfare. The book gives numerous lively examples and accounts about the different achievements of each arm. One can find numerous battles explained with maps, each detailing the successes of a particular use of cavalry, artillery or infantry.

This little book does extremely well in its own modest and pedagogical way what others more convoluted writings fail to achieve: inspire!

As a conclusion: a well written and engaging entry level book. Happy with it and will read it again with pleasure.",0

The plot is extremely intricate, and the reader must work to stay with it, but the work pays off in a terrific resolution.
Though I admire Liss's attention to detail and historical veracity, what I most appreciate is that his characters are convincingly three-dimensional.  Few people are all good or all bad, yet the proliferation in modern fiction of characters who are no more than straw men is appalling.  Liss gives a reader characters that are convincing in their strengths, flaws, and manifold complexities.
All in all, this is one of the better suspense stories of recent years, and I recommend it without qualification.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I adore the 'Lord Peter' series of books by Dorothy Sayers. I found this to have a darker feel to it than most - perhaps due to the lowering skies under which it's set. The plot is, as ever, complex & well-structured, and you learn a lot on the side (if you wish) about campanology, and about what life could be like in the wet lands of Norfolk. The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn. This is a book that I've already read several times, and which I'll enjoy as much the next time I turn to it.

Incidentally, the story does not involve clothing or any form of haberdashery.",0

Now, I can see how much the author has grown since her previous series came out.  This novel is full of fascinating characters, intricate and interweaving plots, and sudden sneaky surprises.  It is a difficult book to read, not in readability terms but in that it really makes you think about what is going on.

Books_5,3,OR,"An enjoyable book to read, although I do disagree that Robb is the second coming of Ellis Peters.  Her plots are complicated just to be complicated and some of her ""good"" characters are unlovably sticky.  Her insistence on the occasional arcane vocabulary seems arbitrary and pettifogging -- especially since perfectly good modern English words are available for most of them.  (After all, her dialogue is actually a ""translation"" of the Chaucerian language they spoke in, anyway.)  Nevertheless, Robb is a good writer and constructor and the book is a romp to read.  Better start the soap opera here, by the way -- she won't catch you up later in the series if you miss an episode.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"I have an impersonal and ever-so-slight connection to the Johnson family (unbeknownst to them) and I was eager to read a 'family history'. This book is not really that. Although it does impart so knowledge and insight, I doubt this book is a sanctioned review of the Johnson heirs. This is the 2nd or 3rd book I've read about America's wealthy elite and sadly, they all sound tragically alike. People without jobs and direction flounder to find purpose in their lives. Few find it in the solace of religion or any other worthy, yet non-lucrative means. This book saddened me, although, being part of the working class population, I did find it somewhat fascintation to see 'how the other 1% lives'.",0

Huguette herself is, of course, a mystery and extremely intriguing.  I was most interested in the close relationship she shared with her mother, Anna, and how Hugette's life changed after her death.  Also, the side bits of conversation with Huguette were worked in very well and added a bit of a different perspective.  All in all, a great read, and highly recommended.",0

This story tells of the long road back to living by a widower writer and a librarian who has her own shadows.

I have had a lifelong love of anything 3-D (movies, comic books, View Master, etc.), plus I grew up during the '50s. This book, in my opinion, is a mirror on life itself (as well as life that has ended). I agree with the reviewer that wished the author had gone into some detail on finding and buying vintage photos. The sad thing is that most of the digital photos taken today will end up lost in la la land in the years to come, never to be seen again.",0

First three chapters of the book are on hikikomori, which are also used to describe the book as a whole, but these chapters have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book. It is like two separate books in one.

The beginning chapters show how far the Jedi Council has moved from a worldview of pure good vs. pure evil to one where questionable tactics are both considered and chosen. Obi Wan makes a great supporting character here.

I just don't think this was well-written, and I don't mean the translation.  I mean the narrative.  Fiction 101 tells a writer to SHOW, NOT TELL.  Instead of making there be anything vivid, let alone convincing, about these people or the pathos of the situation, Larsson tells tells tells.

Travis is hired by a very famous movie star who is being blackmailed due to some photos that show her, in the old-fashioned phrase, in compromising positions. (With more than one guy). The novel was written before you could send pictures on cell phones. McGee must track down the members of the wild party and find out which one is the blackmailer. It's a very good plot as McGee studiously eliminates suspects. And finds some have died and some, possibly, murdered.
  McGee's love interest in this novel is the movie star's secretary who accompanies him on his travels. The reason given for this doesn't really hold up but, hey, she's essential to the plot.

Books_5,3,OR,I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading.,0

Books_5,5,OR,"Review: Dark Wolf (A Carpathian Novel) by Christine Feehan
Release Date: January 7, 2014 | Series: Carpathian (Book 24)
Reviewed by:  Reading in Pajamas/ Donna

REVIEW:
This smoking hot paranormal romance had all the aspects of the Carpathian novels we have grown to love. The danger and intrigue at times left me breathless, but that was tempered well with the love and friendship loaded on the pages. This story also had a fun group of friends that I believed had been together for years. I enjoyed Skylers strength and determination that was clearly shown without ever losing her softness.  Dimitri was perfect for her and the romance flowed smoothly. All in all a well written story that was very hard to put down and I am still lost in their world.

Books_5,3,OR,"I have read and loved every one of the prior KGI books in the series.  The relationship of PJ (the heroine), and Cole(the hero) in the earlier books was one of the same bantering which occurs among all the other KGI operatives, so it strains the credulity when Shades of Gray begins with Cole inexplicably flying to PJ's home town, and then they jump into bed by page 10 or 11!!!  As KGI teammates, they have always cared about each other, so why, when these two otherwise likeable leading characters make love, was it necessary for Maya Banks to write that they each called their physical loving by the ""F"" word?? This is unnecessary crassness, and a big turn-off to the reader. Nevertheless, I will still be hoping for another  KGI  book featuring  Steele as the hero.",0
Books_5,3,OR,"Gayle Lynds definintely has some talent, but as an avid thriller reader, I found her plot and characters too unbelievable--in fact I felt as though I were reading a cheesy romance writer's attempt at murder and mystery.  Everything was just toooooo contrived, from the CIA head, to the Carnivore, to the look-alike cousins, to the clown disguises, to the evil doctor.  For me, this was not a ""page-turner"" and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome.  Unfortunately, the ending was also lame.  I believe Gayle will get better with practice and I would recommend this as a good airplane or waiting room read if you want something glitzy that doesn't take much power of concentration.",0

I'm a pretty quick reader, but after a recent weekend of off-and-on perusing, I found that I had covered only 51 pages of this gargantuan novel, and that it was difficult to go further in view the slow unfolding of this tale.  I seriously wonder about the high praises bestowed by Stephen King and Richard Russo on the back cover--I may come back to this weighty tome at a later date--perhaps when I have much more time to devote to it.  Yet, I must consider that many of the reviewers on this site have given this work mixed reviews.  And unfortunately, several revealed that the ending was a ""Bummer"".

Books_5,3,OR,"J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, does a great job with the In Death series. I've read all of them, some of them multiple times. Her latest effort is somewhat formulistic -- a case long closed suddenly opens up again when a prisoner who she helped to put away escapes and comes looking for her. What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off. I've been wondering about grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. While there are a few tidbits about the mother's early life -- there's nothing there that really rounds her out as a person. I would much rather have had the mother escape, and show up in later works, giving Dallas a chance to explore more of her past. As it is, I think Robb made a mistake on this one.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"Gripping, fascinating science written in a flowing, easily digested style. To say I enjoyed this book would be an understatement. I was utterly enthralled by this book. You'll find the familiar subjects here; Ebola, HIV, etc. But you'll also find viruses you've likely never heard of, learn how biological reservoirs work (as much as they are understood at least), and the vital role of amplifiers in the lives of certain viruses. The various viruses are almost characters in and of themselves as the author delves into how, and why, they do what they do. Even the largely speculative chapter on how HIV might have gotten out of rural Africa and into the cities is fascinating.

If you loved The Hot Zone, this is that book's bigger, brainier sibling. If you are at all interested in biology and physical science, you MUST read this book.",0

This was wordy with huge sections of nothing-ness that didn't advance the plot and didn't help grow the characters. To be honest I found the intrepid, spunky heroine, Abra Walsh, to be very annoying. There wasn't much chemistry between her and Eli Landon. The most interesting character in my opinion was Landon's grandmother and she appeared infrequently. There were two mysteries running simultaneously with a connection--seemed overly convoluted. I don't feel Roberts set the basis for the story very well.

It's interesting to note that this was not just a journey of self-discovery; the event was undertaken with the book in mind, which I felt detracted a bit from the actual experience.

If this book can boast anything it is the clear and unadorned view of America from the road. There are no car chases, no big reveals, and no hidden agendas. McIntyre didn't dress it up with rhetoric, religious or political, he acted as the journalist that he is and reported what he saw; average people living their lives who took a few minutes or hours to help another person.

Having recently finished both ""Fool"" books, it was interesting to note the similarities between the characters SamHall/Don Sullivan and Eileen/Ruth and the towns of North Bath/Mohawk. It was almost as though ""The Risk Pool"" was a first draft of the later novels. All 3 books feature a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well major character, but he is so much more likable in the later 2 iterations. So, if you have limited time or patience and want to read one book about a dysfunctional, alcoholic, ne'er-do-well in a dying upstate New York town, read ""Nobody's Fool.""

I think that the main problem is that the original work is intended for young readers. Therefore, the development of the plot and the building of the characters is over simplistic. That is, if you are a grown up reader, probably this novel will not satisfy you. It is too short, and the characters are very sketchy. They lack depth and so does the story. However, if I were to recommend this book to a young reader, I certainly would. If you are looking to read something from this author, probably The Graveyard Book, while still a novella, gets closer to what a mature reader expects. In any case, watch the film.

Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.

I intend to read the sequels soon, so it is likely her character will be more developed and powerful in them.

Books_5,5,OR,"This is a book that you will want to re-read.  It is complex and ambiguous, so it takes time to ponder over clues and come up with theories as to what exactly happened and what it means.

I will say that the first novella in the book is a very strong, intriguing start.  The second novella describes an alien society.  It is probably a bit perplexing on the first read through, but it is still an entertaining read and you will at least get the overall picture.

I'd recommend this book to any serious science fiction reader, or any serious reader who likes science fiction occasionally.  If you don't like science fiction, you might have a knee jerk reaction to the book just because of its genre.

I would recommend Wolfe's ""the book of the new sun"" first, but this is still a great work that merits a 5 by itself.",0
Books_5,2,OR,"It's a nice enough story, but it's just a story. A really simple story presumably for beginner readers. It took me 2 minutes to read the whole book.

Each page has no more than a paragraph of large text and the adjoining page has a black and white illustration. I think the illustrations are the star of the book and probably why so many people enthuse over it. But really, there's no moral, no point, and it doesn't even make sense (how is Ferdinand the biggest and strongest bull when literally all he ever does is sit and smell flowers?)

I know it's a work for children, so I wasn't expecting much, but I was disappointed at how simple and pointless the work seems. I was expecting a book for around 4th-6th grade, not a black and white picture book. Meh.

Tragedy sets the two brothers on a road trip together, but this is no buddy story about bonding while traveling.  It is one character's realization that his life is going nowhere and that he needs to find a way to change that before he gets to the point where his rut is inevitable.  Along the way, his brother is going through a journey of his own, full of guilt and fear and desperation for his role in a terrible accident.

Until, that is, the night that their daughter's friend drowned in the Hawthornes' pool, a terrible event that put a huge crack in Laurel's carefully maintained facade. The Girl Who Stopped Swimming is a riveting, Southern gothic, family drama, driven by the skeletons in Laurel's closet, her fear for her own daughter, and her love-hate relationship with her glamorous older sister, Thalia. Did someone cause Mollie's drowning? Was it an accident or a murder? What does daughter Shelby know that she isn't telling? Does David have a mistress? Do ghosts really appear to Laurel? And, underlying all these foreboding questions is an even darker one, about a death that occurred during her childhood.

A bit of a weak reasoning behind what ""caused"" Hannibal to be Hannibal the Cannibal.  In fact, I felt there was a big contradiction in the explanation as Hannibal was so disgusted by the Cannibalism that went on during the war (ok it was his sister they ate) that I did not truly believe that he would resort to it himself.

I am left wanting a further book to bridge the significant gap between this one and the rest of the Hannibal Lector books.

She has not made Shadow a super, magical cat with human intelligence.  He's just a cat, with cat-like concerns about food, hunting, and female cats!  The mystery in Last Licks is so-so, and I wasn't sure about the culprit until the end.  But, character development is sadly lacking.

The author has a way of painting the picture of a typical military situation, and the cover of this book is a bit confusing.

The military organization is a separate entity, and it is not very interested in what it is doing, and how it is doing it.

I marked it up for my youngest son, just starting out as an adult. Then I bought two more copies - one for oldest son, and another to replace mine. Adams' style is accessible and clear.

- Use systems, not goals
- Try not to sell your time due to limited upside; your time is finite and limited
- Try to find a product that is infinitely scalable, that you can sell again and again (Intellectual Property might be one way)
- Piecing together complementary skills can make you _very_ much more effective
- Look to maximize your personal energy - the foundation of all else

It's the first half of a 2-part series, which may explain they very many apparently random events and characters and why the ending feels so odd: it's not really the end.

The Long Earth is equal parts SF and real (and very hardcore) science, with a huge number of callbacks to Sir Pterry's Science of Discworld books. Pratchett and Baxter's world-building is outstanding, believable, and meticulous. Well, aside from the steampunk airship. The humour is far more subtle than most of Pratchett's other work; more like Nation than the Discworld novels.

Like Pratchett's Unseen Academicals, The Long Earth has a vaguely hallucinatory feel. This may be intentional, or a symptom of the Embuggerance. For all that, it's a relatively quick and easy read. If you're unsure about buying it, you may want to borrow a copy from a friend.",0

The interesting characters who come by for a visit are sure to delight.

Books_5,5,OR,"The author may have gotten some tips from those classic MasterCard commercials which illustrate that money can buy some things, but certain moments and life experiences are ""priceless.""

Through the beautifully and simply illustrated tale of friendship between a cat and a dog (the interspecies metaphor alludes to openness and acceptance of differing points of view and experiences), we learn that material possessions and tangible items are sometimes not as meaningful as the space between two individuals, people, living beings, etc.  It is the unspoken, uncategorizable, sublime moments of life that are most fulfilling and rewarding, and the hardest to capture or describe.  Therefore, when trying to convey the depth of meaning of these moments, we cannot, and therefore, should not even bother trying (to encapsulate them, try as we may through photographs, video, blogging, etc.).  The best gift is one that one already has the power to give oneself--the gift of friendship, self-awareness/mindfulness and the ability to honor and nurture the two.",0

I'll give him credit for that, but not much else.  The way Obama grinds though flag officers makes me wonder how much longer the military system will continue to produce the highly competent high level Generals and Admirals we must have to stay safe in a world that seems to hate us for who we are.

She tells it like it is, breaking down her lessons, and her life, into small meaningful chapters which pull the reader in and carry him or her through to the lesson and the meaning. This book isn't the ""pollyanna think and you'll be happy"" refrain that some authors offer. Instead, Gabby brings you into the harsh light of day, giving real life examples to the lessons, and honestly, and sometimes painfully sharing aspect of her life which a lesser person might have kept hidden.

Gabby is an inspiration to all of us spirit junkies out there, the meaning to keep trying and carry on, yet she challenges the reader to change, to look at her life in a new way, and in the end, Spirit Junkie will take the reader on a journey of introspection, transformation, and love.",0

My former beliefs gave me so much comfort and joy, and a sense of purpose, all of which have now been torn from me. Therefore, I don't condemn or rail against those who still cling to them fiercely.

Although this book was slightly slow to start, and it took me about 5 or 6 chapters to see the charm in Wren, the ending had my eyes bugged out of my head and my heart beating wildly.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

Books_5,4,OR,"Ok - First thing is that this book for the price is well worth it.  It is well put together, and has some great projects that will get you started interfacing arduino with android.

Please note that this book focuses almost entirely on the Arduino side of things.  It shows wiring it up, sketches, electronics,etc, in great detail.

For the android ... it does not teach you any programming. It just shows to download .apk to interface with projects.

So for me, (A complete Android beginner) (Lots experience with Arduino) - this book was a mixed bag.  They are great projects, but focus on showing the arduino, not the android side of things.

For instance -- the temp reading gauge. Building a temp reading for arduino is trivial... which is what is documented in the book.  The slick output to read on the phone is downloadable .apk, with no discussion of gui building,etc.

Being chased by an evil spy and a Magi, they encounter a lost city in the desert, a djinn, a desert of actual souls (hence, the title), and other beings and objects, natural and magical.

It's written in the style of the Arabian Nights but with an emphasis on the action-adventure of a sword-and-sorcery tale.  The author also conjures up new magical creations and beings not found in the typical Arabian Nights tale.

People had a hard time looking at him, so of course, he would feel like the beast. I also liked the spunk of Katherine. My heart ached for her, on the reaction of her father, just because she was a women. I truly can't believe this book is free, I liked it that much. There is love making, but not the erotica type.

Middle was creepy, suspenseful, and had some horrific images.  It also had sermons and discussions about religion that I skipped.  Was more interested in the actual mystery than the author's repeated return to philosophy where he kept asking 'what is the unknown' through various guises.

Ending was scattershot, and it did not resolve anything in terms of character inter-relationships.  Author wrote a super-slow beginning where he painstakingly laid down a hierarchy of relationships, and the ending made no effort to build on or resolve any of that.

I wasn't into this one much.  Russo did have a big success in that the unknown aliens were actually unknown, alien, scary and incomprehensible.

Kaitlin slowly falls for the one person her and her family have known to despise, however, as the reader starts to grasp the power of love in this novel...it gives judgment a whole new meaning.

Mary E. Pearson knows what she's doing. I love the surprise, twist'n turns and the balance of drama, romance, and mystery in this novel.

In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

These are the milestones of achievement marking the road to the extreme points on our earth, which have always inspired the sons of others nations.

The woman's voice is that of Hannah Musgrave Sundiata, a.k.a. Dawn Carrington, the darling of the title. What a misnomer! She is anything but darling. Selfish, self-absorbed and admittedly lacking any maternal instinct whatsoever, Hannah is not a sympathetic character, in spite of all she endures, nor even a very likeable one.

This is a story of a political radical's flight to W. Africa and her subsequent marriage to a black Liberian, which results in the births of three children. It is, of course, a tale of politics, race relations, and terrorism. But it is also a story of one woman's efforts to learn about herself and to make a life of value.

This is a very interesting and well presented account  although I found the battle scenes lacking in depth but I would suppose  that was not the authors main focus but more on the people involved. I  think it may have helped to have added a few maps of the fighting in Mexico  and the Valley as if you have no prior knowledge of these areas you really  do not appreciate the efforts involved in moving from one point to another.

Walker is Ian Brown's son.  Walker is one of about 300 other people worldwide who have a syndrome called cardiofacioutaneous (CFC).  Ian talks about taking care of Walker, both the good and the bad.  Ian writes about his marriage, other daughter, and his quest of understanding his life with Walker. Brown not only chronicles his honest journey (both good and the hard) of taking care of his disabled child, but is actually going on a quest to educate himself (and us) about the condition of CFC.  Ian meets other families with CFC and becomes almost the experts himself on it.  He learns/teaches us to love himself, Walker, and to believe in the life he has been given.

The characters are real and complex and the plot is captivating. But more than that, it's a book that shows the humanity of different individuals, while not shying away from the brutality of others. Using Death as the narrator adds another dimension to the novel. Nothing is new to Death, and yet he is moved and intrigued by this story and shares it with us, showing us the complexity of humanity. The Book Thief is the best contemporary young adult book I've read. I know some people feel it was wrongly marketed that way, but I think it fits the audience well, while not writing down to them. The voice and style are distinct enough to make it feel special, while the subject matter and characters are real enough to tell a great deal of truth about the human condition.

The plot and characters are creative, and the writing is descriptive and enjoyable. Lawrence portrays the main character as distinctly human in his attributes and flaws which is a breath of fresh air from other novels. Presenting a character that could be you or me or anyone, thrust into an adventure unwillingly and forced to play the cards as fate deals them. I also enjoy Lawrence' very non-linear and unorthodox story lines. He's very creative with coming up with non-traditional fantasy elements and weaving them together into a very solid story.

Streep covers her own experiences from young girlhood to adulthood. She backs up her position with plenty of research, and testimonies from other women. Although her writing weaves from one person to another and one time period to another, it flows quite well.

I praise streep for this book. I think anyone who felt unloved as a child ( and still as an adult ) will appreciate this. Because the phenomenom of unloving mothers is so largely hidden,it has taken a while for people to recognise it. Streep is one of the brave pioneers who, in recent years, has tackled this topic.

She may have a slight tendency to be a doormat, but all women tend to (at least during some stage of their lives) put everyone else before themselves. Yet Gina typically does that only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that may yet deny him what he most needs--a woman who will love and accept him just as he is, poverty and all.

Their struggle to escape the hurts of the past and to work through their doubts and fears enables this book to be a remarkable romance that champions the power of love. Devon is the character who really changes in this novel, and his emotional battles are the usually the most compelling. But Gina holds her own and is the perfect mate for him.

Looking back, this first book was one of the more hilarious of the five.  It is characterized by Adams' traditional zany style of humor (prevalent in the first 3, not so much in the last 2).

The idea that someone might steal life threads from The Fates for their own nefarious use... ingenious!

To add to the mayhem, Tessa finds herself falling for William de Chaucy, who is as alluring as he is maddening. I enjoyed the push and pull between these characters. They both have strong personalities that don't always mesh and neither controls the other... they're very much equals.

Overall this is solid sci-fi action. Nothing exceptional, just fine. It would probably be hard to follow if I hadn't read the previous books, but all the characters are growing nicely into their roles, and the plot rolls along to a satisfying conclusion. It's a quick read, and I enjoyed it fine.

Except for one thing.

The very end is just terrible. The end of the plot about a pirate fleet taking over systems and disrupting communication is fine, obvious, but fine. But after that ends, the book goes on to give a tag about the end of the romantic tension between two of the lead characters. It's a terrible scene. I mean, it's short, but just ridiculous. Not funny, not romantic: I was embarrassed on the characters' behalf. The romance isn't built up in a way that should lead to a scene that is so juvenile.

The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants books are 3 of the best books I've ever read. I even made my mother read them, and she loved them as much - if not more - as I did.

Anne Brashares really delves deeply into each girl. They are not simply characters to make the book happen, but characters with feelings, emotions and problems that we can all relate to. They each have real relationships with their mothers, they are loyal and devoted to each other, and they have problems which they deal with honestly. Things like that in a book can't help but make it a good read, don't you think?

I certainly hope that Anne Bashares writes more for the series because I will be first on line to by them!

Meet Meena, the heroine of the story, who thinks that vampires are just another fad and is forced to write them into her soap opera to compete with all the other vamp shows out there.  She thinks it's a riot since people are obsessed with something that doesn't exit... or sparkle in the daylight.  Until she is saved one night by a man whom protects her during a random attack... then she begins to wonder but continues to pass it off as a one-off until she can't ignore the truth any longer... vampires are very, very real.

The story focuses on how 3 teens cope with this reality as they ""come of age"".  The book is written from a first person perspective.  It is very well written and edited.  The pacing is slower than other dystopian contemporaries, but the flipside of this is a richer narrative of the main character's thoughts, logic, emotion and confusion (I wouldn't quite define it as angst).

Other characters aren't much better: Maureen, another fat white vampire, is a little less irritating than Jules, if only because her appearances are in measured doses; and the antogonist, Malice X, seems an amalgamation of every movie stereotype of black men. Only Doodlebug, Jules' cross-dressing former sidekick, breaths any sort of life into this story, although even s/he can't save the flagging pace of the book's final third.

The first 20 or so pages of The Children Act promised to be a return to his heights. I was hoping. He has a knack of writing a gripping opening (notably Enduring Love) and then letting it slip a little... there was so much promise in the opening and then it basically deflated towards the end. He does seem to be predisposed to write about the upper middle class and their emotional problems as they drink fine wines and listen to classical music... alongside the freak-show of the lower classes and their predisposition towards stupidity, violence and slyness.

As he did in BUDDHISM WITHOUT BELIEFS, Stephen Batchelor cuts through the mindless dogma and gets to the core of Buddha's teachings.  This time he has written a more personal document, starting with his experiences as a Tibetan, then Zen monk, leaving the monastic life and marrying, and searching for the historical Buddha and his teachings.  It is a compelling story.  It is not for those who want to cling to comforting beliefs, but for those who seek liberating new perspectives.

This murder is still haunting me for the rest of my life. I will read it again and again and again.

I also enjoyed reading about the scene of the killer's haunting and the ghost town. It's very sad that Houdini is gone, but the ghost town is still haunting me. I also liked the description of the building, and the people that live there.

It has a folksy, quaint, lacksadaisical feel to it, and the tone stays consistent throughout the moments of political strife within the institution, as well as the bombing of the school during WWI.

The story is reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. There's a girl who really likes lima beans, but nobody else likes lima beans so she always lies and says she doesn't because she's super worried about what everybody thinks of her. Because of that, she starts changing colors based on what other people want her to be. This expands to changing shape, and then becoming even more surreally assimilated into all the furniture and decorations in her bedroom. At the very end, a little old woman says, ""I bet you want some lima beans,"" and the girl says, ""No! Nobody likes lima beans! Wait, never mind I like lima beans!""

The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty

This book tells the story of three women:  Rachel, Cecilia and Tess, and how they are connected in ways that are unknown even to them. Rachel's daughter was murdered as a teenager. Cecilia is feeling unsatisfied with her normally perfect life as wife and mother. Tess's husband has fallen in love with her cousin, so she packs up her young son and goes back home to her mother's. All three women are dealing with tons of issues, to varying degrees of success. These women are interesting and complex. There is a decent mystery plot to this book to keep readers engaged. At times this book is a tad predictable but that did not take away enjoyment from reading it. I liked Moriarty's book What Alice Forgot so I chose this one from Amazon Vine to review. I was not disappointed. I enjoy her writing style; it is easy and enjoyable to read without being fluff. Moriarty creates interesting characters that will keep readers hooked in her books.

One wonders a bit how much time it took her to obtain all that training, and whether that's the norm for National Park employees, but quibbles aside, this is a superb book. Barr uses the drama of a fire to isolate her cast of characters in classic locked-room mystery fashion, then cuts them off from the outside world while Anna races against time to figure out who she can trust before she becomes the next victim. If there's a flaw it lies in the fact that a vital clue is a bit too obvious. I can't say more without giving away too much, but people who've read lots of mysteries will probably figure out part of what's going on simply from the way the story is constructed. Firestorm, however, is really a story of fire, firefighters, and the southern Cascades in the vicinity of Mt.

Scott Turow

This is the first one of  Scott Turow's books I have read and as I understand there was a movie made from this book.

A beautiful lawyer from the prosecuting attorney's office is raped and murdered. Rusty Sabich is chief deputy prosecutor for Kindle County, and his boss Raymond Horgan is up for re-election.  Rusty is handling the investigation of the murder despite the conflict that only he is aware of with his friend, Dan Lipramzer investigating the crime. They first focus on convicted sex offenders that Carolyn helped to prosecute. Then Rusty learns that his boss Horgan had a brief relationship with Carolyn. Meanwhile Rusty's marriage is in a shambles as his wife Barbara knows about his affair. As evidence surfaces Rusty he is arrested for the killing.  But is Rusty guilty?  Or will someone else be found to have done the terrible crime.

Instead of being a predictable legal thriller, like some others I have read, this great murder mystery has plenty of twists and turns through its thick and plot.

The book was supplied to me free of charge and did not ask that I do a positive review.",0

I read this book in the middle of the night, and I'm a bit nauseated by the fact that I'd been reading it for about two hours. I wasn't sure what the story was about, but I guess it just made me feel better about myself. It was great. I just didn't want to put it down. The story was all about the very first person, and that is exactly what I wanted. The character development, the characters, the world building. There is a lot of blood, but that doesn't detract from the story. It was a lot more focused on the main character, and the relationship between him and her. It was a good read, and a great story.

Books_5,5,OR,"Emilie du Chatelet was a most interesting women for her time, or for any time. A member of the French aristocracy she was adored by her father and taught unwomanly things like sword fighting, riding, languages, literature and mathematics. She also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress.

As a scientist she is remembered as a footnote, if you will, to the other scientists of the day. She did research into fire, and developed theories of what is now called infra-red radiation. In the year of her death she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her own commentary, of Newton's celebrated Principia Mathematica, including her derivation from its principles of mechanics the notion of conservation of energy.

She also led a life we would consider somewhat scandalous. After dutifully presenting her husband with the children expected of an arranged marriage they agreed to live apart with each taking other lovers.

I was struck with the fact that she died in 1749. Had she been born fifty years later, it is likely that she would have faced the guillotine like so many others.",0

It takes a ""dog whisperer"" style of understanding dogs and treating them with respect, understanding that the real key to dog training is to train YOU how to teach your dog.  The book is full of not only very specific and well developed training techniques, but it also goes on to give solutions and ideas if a puppy is not learning the desired skill.  I found it extremely practical, far more than other books I bought.  It corresponds and doesn't conflict with the manners and socialization classes we are taking for puppy training.  The progression of skills is very logical, allowing you to train using logical building blocks.  Getting the first series of lessons taught to puppy leads you in a logical sequence to the next chapter.

Conan Doyle set ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" there, and King uses a rumored reappearance of the hound as the pretext for drawing her sleuthing couple there. They're summoned by the eccentric clergyman, author and hymn writer (""Onward Christian Soldiers"") Sabine Baring-Gould, now nearly 90 and in failing health.

But before the inquiry gets underway, we're given a long dissertation from Mrs. Holmes about Baring-Gould and Dartmoor. Between the suspicious death of a local who wandered off the straight and familiar and the discovery of a body in the good minister's lake, there's nearly 200 pages of Russell reading Baring-Gould's books, Russell talking with the man and Russell riding about the countryside and chatting up the locals.

Traven/Travis/Tallis/etc. appears as one man, moving through different evolutionary experiments, physical and psychological. He is experimenting with his psyche, as Ballard experiments with storytelling and writing. Chapter headings like ""The University of Death,"" ""Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown"" and ""You and Me and the Continuum"" give an idea towards the scope of the characters' inner and outer explorations.  The experimental sexual interactions, recurring alternate deaths and celebrity obsessions are from lists produced by Ballard using free assocation. Glimpses of themes of many of his later works can be found in this text.
Special features of the Re/Search revised edition includes an introduction by William S. Burroughs, new notes and comments from Ballard, and four additional short stories. Notes and commentary from Ballard himself run in the margins alongside the text to which they are related.  The collection of medical illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner is impressive. Often overlooked are the excellent black and white urban images, photographed by Ana Barrado.

Books_5,3,OR,"Cary Grant was gorgeous, suave, a very good actor, and at times could be a controlling and confused man. Dyan Cannon writes about Mr. Grant with openness, and yes, is is HER autobiography as well as his biography in a sense. Covering the years from her start in Hollywood to just about the current day, Ms. Cannon does not hold back in her analysis of what made Mr. Grant tick. Having read several books by other authors, and having a film history background, there was little in the book that made me doubt Ms. Cannon's veracity. Cary Grant was open about his LSD experimentation and was constantly searching for depth and meaning in his personal life and retired at probably just the perfect moment; before his looks were regarded as passes to 1960s filmgoers and just as he himself was growing bored with his work.

The latter part of the book focuses on the repercussions of her marriage and life with Cary Grant and much was new and enlightening. (I do not spoil plots or details).

I liked the parallel structure of the book, switching back and forth in time from the modern-day part of the story in which the granddaughter, Cline, is dealing with her mothers poor health, her conniving half-siblings (characters who come up just short of comic-opera levels of villainy), and a search in the French Riviera town of Juan-les-Pins for a mysterious bequest from her grandmother Ondine.

The book is somewhat uneven in structure and execution, trying just a little too hard at times to sustain the edge and the mystery, casting one too many stumbling blocks in the way as Cline delves into her mothers and het grandmothers pasts, and delving a time or two into some quite frankly erotic scenes which, while not offensive were rather graphic, and a bit out of character with the rest of the book.

As the most powerful ""demonic"" force in all of Hell, outside of Satan himself, the vampires are the undead elite...snobs, if you will.  Their views toward other preternatural creatures can be seen as a vague social commentary of our world today.

Another interesting twist to the story is in the character of Carlos Riveria.  What becomes of a man who willingly sells his soul to evil but dies with a prayer in his heart?  The battle of good versus evil in the war for souls just got personal.

ORIGINAL REVIEW WRITTEN IN 2002:

This is an entertaining book, once again not for people under the age of 12, because of some of the content, but Meg Cabot has this way of writing in making all these situations hilarious while mixing just the right amount of Fantasy and Reality together and one hilarious story that while fantastical is a reflection of real life as a teenager.

 I was unable to put this book down (it was truly a struggle when I did have to take a break from reading it). That is a true rarity in books, this is not like a classic nor will it ever be, but it essentially good pulp romance for teens, something teens should be able to enjoy  for years to come.

I suggest you read the first, and then read this. Do not watch the movie then read this book because the premise and story of both book and movie are 100% dissimilar.  Not a book to take seriously, but a great piece of fantasy to take your mind off of the real world for a bit.

God Bless ~Amy

Books_5,5,OR,"This is genuine adult fantasy at its finest. I don't mean it is pornographic, though there are sexual elements presented within reason. What I mean is that Bakker does not try to beat around the bush here. His characters are flawed, in fact here perfection is defined as the ability to manipulate others. The most likable characters are often the weak ones, but it is in fact this weakness that gives them compassion for others. There are no definite good guys, even those seeking to battle against the apocalypse are suspect. After all, if you are fighting for such a worthy cause isn't any evil excusable?

And if all men and women are manipulated by their emotions, their past experiences, is it really a crime to use them or hurt them? Are they not machines? These are the questions Bakker poses in the course of the novel, which is filled with political intrigue, military conquest, and realistic love stories. What I mean by realistic is that there are no virgin princesses, no knights in shining armor, but rather imperfect people loving each other. This is definitely one of the more honest fantasies that has come down the pipe in quite some time.",0
Books_5,3,OR,"On the off chance that like me you've read Big Chief Elizabeth and Samurai William (or at least one of them), it may be worth me stating that in my opinion this is the least impressive of the three. In agreement with the review below, Nathaniel's 'story occupies only a small part of this book', and it remains a trifle unconvincing that his 'endeavours were pivotal in the course of history'.

That being said, there are all the usual details - from tragic biographies to prolonged and agonising torture - to keep you turning the pages, and it is certainly interesting to read once again about how horrible those Dutch were to the poor English (as can also be read about in Samurai William). Then, of course, Milton is great at weaving a yarn together, and it is always fascinating to read about the exploits of various larger-than-life adventures; particularly those exploits centred on parts other than the 'spiceries' themselves. The book is a light and enjoyable read, but it is most certainly worth a read. Milton's greatest contribution to history is, I feel, his abilities to take a reader's imagination so convincingly back to a time of pirates and uncharted adventure.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.

The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scenes was a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This was not good vs evil, it was just two people who happened to be on two different sides of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII.

My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapters are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax. Personally, I found that climax to be a bit anti-climactic. But overall, that detracted very little from my enjoyment of the novel and would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, WWII, or well-written literature.",0

I disagree. There are times when the first word that comes to mind is the easy word that does not get at the real meaning of a character's thought, or the feeling I want to convey. If I just write, ""the room was cold,"" I've shortchanged the reader. How cold and why does the temperature matter?  But if I show that people wear two pairs of thick wool socks just to sit inside, or get up three times in the night to make sure the baby's bed cap is on his head, or have another character remark that the mercury has frozen in the thermometer, the reader feels the cold.

Okay, so maybe she isn't a typical NYC woman, but what she is is a fun character. In this sequel to Insatiable, readers are welcomed back into her life six months after the first novel ends.

As the novel opens, readers see Meena as a serious agent for the Palatine. Her brother Jon is still trying to get a job with the Palatine. Alaric still wants Meena. Lucien still wants to make Meena his bride.

And that's just the start of it. There is a rising vampire army hunting Meena; there is the Palatine hunting Lucien; and there is something ""off"" about the new members of the Palatine.

With a fast-paced plot and quite a few twists and turns throughout, Cabot has written an intriguing sequel. If you enjoyed Insatiable, you will not be disappointed with Overbite.

Also, while I think flawed characters make for much better stories, there are better ways to write in the ""flaws"" than having an antagonist point them out at every opportunity. Also, the attempt at romantic tension between the heorine and the male character grated on my nerves.

He's being an ass to push her away because he really wants to be close to her but can't for reaon xxx....  SMDH. Very irritating. This old saw is too reminiscent of soap opera sterotypes and bad dramas. If the reader can get past these issues, and the author can learn to avoid these sterotype pitfalls, future books by this author could be very promising. I think the author could really develope a rich fictional world that would keep many mystery readers turning pages.

This story is pretty much documenting Leah's journey West once she discovers the truth about her uncle. I wanted gun fights and showdowns, not the dark reality of a pilgrimage West.

That being said, the realism is one of the highlights of the novel for me. What I really enjoyed about this book was that it was very realistic.

It had its own little plot and likeable characters. Then came the second chapter and that was also okay. Less exciting, more people to meet. Then the third chapter came along and there were WAY too many people. A whole band of them, at least one of which who had a regular name and then a nickname and that was just too much. And then the fourth chapter, which was yet more characters, not just one or two, but a whole passel of them, some of whom are using their real names and also a nickname and it was just too much. I could not keep all of the characters straight. And I know that the book is told from a series of other characters' viewpoints about a couple of characters, but it's just too much. I could not handle all these people. I really liked the writing in the first chapter, so there's that. I just can't read books that throw way too many people at me all at once.",0
Books_5,3,OR,"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. I couldn't relate to the author's neverending supply of supportive friends who helped her all along the way with her issues. I found myself wanting to feel more sorry for her lack of relationship with her family, but I had some questions. She left her brother out of her story almost altogether. How did he react to events?

I couldn't relate to the somewhat shallow craving for shopping and closets full of shoes. I don't lament things. I'm not into prosperity gospel. And who gets to go on a long retreat to Alaska to heal? Almost none of us. I think I was hoping for more of a workbook than a personal account. The book touches on a lot of good points about biblical laments in Psalms, Job, Lamentations. Some of the stories became repetitive and I think it could have been condensed a bit. The book is a good commentary of realizing that many of us are not ""just fine.",0

Derleth's take on Lovecraft follows a certain theme that doesn't change all that much from story to story:  thin, white, bookish, guy inherits spooky old house by some half-forgotten relative/friend; weird stuff happens that he can't explain; bookish guy inevitably does research in old tomes at Arkham; and the story ends in a paragraph of italics that's supposed to fill you with a sense of horror.  The sense of spookiness that permeated throughout Lovecraft's stories is absent, replaced by an extremely predictable italicized ending.  I have to agree with the reader from San Francisco, the Good gods versus the Bad gods was not a great idea.  Of course it doesn't really matter, since a few gods are merely mentioned in passing when the bookish guy does research at Miskatonic.  Derleth seems to prefer Lovecraft's theme of evil rednecks in the backwoods of Massachusetts rather than promoting anything in the Cthulu mythos.

Books_5,4,OR,"TRUNK MUSIC is the fifth Harry Bosch detective novel and may be the best of the series so far. Mr. Connelly writes sharp dialogue and page-turning narrative.

Set in LA and Las Vegas, TRUNK MUSIC gets the reader involved in Hollywood slease, police corruption and mob antics on the way to solving the murder of a man left in the trunk of his car (hence ""trunk music""). I am getting a bit tired with Harry Bosch getting in trouble with his police bosses and IAD (Internal Affairs Division) and his fellow detectives suspecting him of being a rogue cop. I mean, Harry has solved many murders brilliantly and, by now, they should be trusting him more. So it seems a little unrealistic that they still come down hard on him for doing his job. Perhaps Mr. Connelly will see the logical flaw in the plot there and correct that with different plot complications and tensions in future Harry Bosch books.

Books_5,2,OR,"I am a big fan of John Grisham, not only of his legal thrillers but also of his more literary undertakings. ""Playing for Pizza"" was just a huge disappointment for me. It felt like a potboiler Grisham dashed off to justify the expense of an Italian vacation or to make use of some scrap notes he'd made while working on a larger project.

The book's characters are quite 2-D. Ex-NFL quarterback Rick Dockery does undergo a small amount of personal growth in his acceptance of his situation in Italy but that's a pretty minor transformation against a backdrop of predictable stereotypical supporting cast members.

The plot is all but non-existent. It's really a slice of life rather than a true narrative. It has a beginning and a middle but no end. Not only is the story line unfinished (that's not a crime, but in this case it's piled on top of the other issues the book presents and adds to the sense of incompletion), it's not clear it would have been interesting had Grisham bothered to bring it to a conclusion.

Overall, it's not only that I expect more of Grisham, it's that I expect more from any good book. This book just doesn't rank as one I'd recommend to anyone.",0

From The Book: A Novel by Diana Adams

Author: Diana Adams

Publisher: T&E

I enjoyed this book.  It was a very interesting story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over 50 years.  As they are getting older and having to deal with the past, they are facing a new life together.  They are both young women who are very interested in each other.  They are both going through a difficult time, but they are also going through a very difficult time.  They are both trying to make it through the time together.  The story was very well written and the characters were well developed.  I think the main reason I give it 5 stars was because it was a very good story.  I think the book is very well written and the story line is very interesting.  I think I would recommend it to anyone.  I am not sure if this is the best or the worst book",1

The characters are interesting, and the plots are very interesting. I think this is one of the better novels on the subject. This is a great read for anyone interested in history. I received this book free from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This book was a total shocker. It's very sad that this book is out of print. The author, William F. Martin, wrote a book that was so bad it's hard to put down. However, the author went out of his way to make the book look like a ghost story. It's a shame because this is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I'm going to read it again. I really enjoyed the book. It's a great read. I can't wait for the next book in this series.",1
Books_5,4,OR,"This might be my favorite celebrity memoir audiobook to date, simply because Martin Short is so freaking entertaining. On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one...

While the narration performance was expectedly funny and entertaining (Short does a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well as of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moments captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man has the memory of an elephant because he was able to recall events and moments in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it was truly astonishing.

These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoirs have become my favorite things to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and details of things I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers.

If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it.

In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.
I used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.

Having never heard of Elizabeth Peters, I was surprised to find that she's a prolific author with many best-selling mysteries and is an expert in Egyptology. This is the first of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I quite liked this book. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Agatha Christie. The story was written around English characters with the same language and general ""atmosphere."" I was happy, however, that the story didn't have the same ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" ending that Christie was famous for, although Peters seemed to be emulating that. The ending wasn't a big surprise.

I enjoyed the story, and the main character is portrayed with with and strength. I loved that a woman of that time period was strong and feisty. I am bemused by Amelia's friend and companion, Evelyn, who faints at the drop of a hat. Who does that? Perhaps her corset was too tight. The writing was good, there was NO foul language or explicit scenes. I would classify this book as a ""cozy.""

Books_5,1,OR,"All the hundreds of thousands of wannabe writers out there (including yours truly) and THIS is what gets published.  Granted, it's a great premise, its just terrible writing and saddest of all (judging by the success of this series) no one can tell the difference.

On the other hand, it's only fair that I point out that I've seen the comic book version and it's perfectly suited for that medium, it works much better in that form.

I'm not here to bash the writer, her success or loyal fans, just offering a warning to anyone who might stumble across this review to reconsider before diving in.

They were character driven and shared the lives of the main characters, Peter Decker and Rina, as their relationship grew into marriage and family.  More literary in writing style and with characters you came to care about, you almost forgot the books were in the ""Mystery"" genre.  Admittedly, I hadn't read a number of the novels in the middle of the series, but jumped to ""Gun Games"".  Although the elements of the early Decker/Lazarus novels were there, it seemed more ""commercially"" than ""character"" driven.  The ""F"" word abounds and even when it might fit the character and situation; it is over used.  Other graphic sexual terms and situations are also included.  The book seemed a mixed up jumble of young teenaged romance and sex with a mystery thrown in involving more of the same.  That said, the main characters, the foster son of Decker and Rina, 15 year old, Gabe, and his 14 year old girlfriend, are characters you like and hope to see as adults moving on with their lives in a later book.

Gabriel was great as always, he has been my number one book boyfriend since day one, and he did not disappoint.

Maybe the author felt like the story was about Gabriel and Julia and they didn't need to be answered, or maybe it was left open on purpose for a book four, I don't know, but I would have liked to know how their story ended as well.

Books_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed reading Tuesdays with Morrie.  The book is a sportswriter's account of how his old, favorite college professor deals with getting ALS, a fatally, progressive neurological disease.  It's a moving story, even though you can pretty much guess how it ends up.  It reads very quickly and is not long, any longer and it may have become tedious.

It appears that the story is true, possibly written during a newspaper writer's strike several years ago.  The real hooker for the story is hearing what Morrie feels is important in life and how to live it.  Even though his own life is coming to a close, Morrie seems to still enjoy being alive, though there is also some denial.  Ablom and his professor, Morrie, met on Tuesday's.

In another way I think the book is very valuable.  Morrie points out that there is actually an advantage of dying an agonizingly slow death--it gives him the time to say what he has to say and do what has to be done.  As a physician who frequently deals with patients and families who confront death, I was refreshed by this insight.  It's the exact opposite of what we all wish for, a quick and painless death.",0

After the way Levi had reacted to his fathers death in an earlier book, it was great to see his return to the family. But sometimes coming back isn't easy, as many readers have undoubtedly experienced, and Levis struggles to fit in ring true. He just blossoms as the relationship with Julia and her daughter develops, fulfilled by being needed.

With its focus on some of the grittier aspects of life, such as death and physical abuse, this story shows that the Amish face the same life struggles that we do.

And I have to say that one of my favorite things about An Amish Family Christmas is spending more time with Simon, a character who touched me greatly.

Levis personal growth and Julia learning to trust make this a moving story  with a fabulous conclusion filled with Christmas cheer. I loved the whole series and highly recommend it to all who enjoy Amish fiction.

Books_5,4,OR,"This review is specifically about the leather-bound Easton Press edition, for those who are contemplating buying this version.  It really is a beautiful looking book.  It is bound in rust-brown full leather, with orange and metallic gold ornamentation on the front cover and spine, with all page edges gilt.  (On the scan I have entered onto Amazon, the gold stamping looks very dull; it's difficult to scan reflective metallic colours.  The appearance of the book when seen in person is much more brilliant that the photo suggests.)

This edition measures six-and-a-half by nine inches in size, is 204 pages in length, and contains numerous black-and-white line drawings by Kay Nielsen.  It also contains full-colour plates by the artist---HOWEVER---here is the problem.  There were 25 paintings done for the original edition of this book, and the Easton Press edition only contains eight of them.  I cannot imagine why on earth this ""luxury"" edition of the book doesn't contain all of the colour plates; I'm totally baffled by the omission of nearly two-thirds of the artwork.  If not for that fact, this really would be the perfect edition of the book to own.  But as it is, I don't know that this Easton edition is worth the price.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"I won't mince words: this book is a complete downer. The first half consists of Eileens diatribe, a scathing attack on her father, herself, her life. But the writing marks Ottessa Moshfegh as an author to watch.

Moshfegh gives us a thoroughly dislikeable narrator in the scrawny, shambolic shape of Eileen who has an unspeakable attitude, appalling habits and an entirely dysfunctional relationship with her alcoholic ex-cop father. They live in utter squalor in a town Eileen refers to only as X-ville. She works in the office of a local correctional facility for young male offenders and doesnt have a friend in the worlduntil one day Rebecca walks into the workplace. Beautiful, glamorous, confident  Rebecca is everything Eileen is not. But is Rebecca for real?

The ominous tone hanging over this story is compounded by the frequent phrases of foreboding generously scattered throughout. I have to say I'm not a fan of this device - it's rather too manipulative of the reader - and as is so often the case, the outcome doesn't quite live up to the suspense nor is the character of Rebecca satisfactorily explained. The book is by no means an easy read in terms of its seedy subject matter but it is, nevertheless, an interesting, fearless and thoughtful piece of work.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"As usual, Harry Bosch is a fascinating enigma; Michael Connelly is a master at the police procedural. It is New Years Day and a dog finds a bone in the Hollywood Hills. The dogs owner, a physician, knows the bone is human  a 10 to 12 year-old boy.

Thus begins an intriguing case that makes lots of hard turns. The murder occurred 20 to 25 years before and the victim was brutalized on a regular basis.

The case is fascinating, Harrys love interest and their relationship is not. Julia, a boot, is a mature woman who went through the police academy months earlier.

As sharp as Harry is, he begins a relationship with her rather quickly  even though it is against LAPDs policy for a supervisor and new recruit to be romantically involved. I just didn't feel that the relationship was real; the interactions seemed wooden.

One of the things that I like about Michael Connelly is that he isn't afraid to take chances with his main character, Harry. The case provides one surprise after another but the ending was a shocker.

She is getting her life back together after she was tortured. She was in awful 'relationship' which is mentioned in Beg for Mercy. She was helped by Jack.

I really despise lazy authors who do not at least do some research before they begin writing about something they know nothing about.

Books_5,2,OR,"I bought this book with great expectation having read the glowing reviews here at amazon.  The premise of the story sounded intriguing---two 'ordinary' couples meet and form a friendship that lasts a lifetime.  Alas, real life is often dull and this book redefines dull.  The promise of youth and the sadness of aging no matter how gracefully, the love that endures sickness and health, the value of true friendship are all examined and with introspective honesty.  However, what isn't in the book, the great moments glossed over or ignored, left this reader wondering how Wallace Stegner got to be so renowned.
On a more positive note, if you can endure the first 3/4 of the book, the last 1/4 will be uplifting.  The reader will finally get some insight into Charity and Syd's dysfunctional marriage, Larry's unquestioning love for the invalid Sally, and the universality of Stegner's premise that one of us doesn't differ that much from another, each generation repeating its parents so that everything returns upon itself, repeating and renewing until the present can hardly be told from past.

By the time Auda is grown, she has learned her father's craft and has learned to express herself clearly in her writing. Few of the people around her are literate, but Auda has fashioned a life for herself.

Between assisting in the papermaking, serving as a scribe, and hiding her albino features, Auda has learned to move around in her world. Despite the danger to her person, Auda is not one to trade freedom for safety or independence for marriage. Though with the spread of the Inquisition's power, Medieval Europe is fraught with danger for anyone who seems different - and Auda knows that she can never blend in.

When Auda obtains the job of scribe in the castle, she flourishes. Her skills and writing bring her the respect and appreciation of powerful women. But her writing and beliefs also bring danger and loss.

Watermark is a carefully crafted and fascinating work of historical fiction. It's a story of love, fear and superstition, and of the struggle to keep one's identity.

Also, I really liked the character of the villain, Acheron Hades. He was so deliciously evil. And seemingly invincible. Fforde's writing style was really great too; you know, that British style.

Just like DeMille used to do in his other novels. Shoehorning real life events into his recent books has taken priority over a strong narrative and the storytelling suffers under this neglect. It's a blatant attempt at broadening his appeal that does so at the detriment of his longtime fans' intellect.

It's also worth noting he's writing books now that run about half the number of pages his past work offered. It's been pointed out he has contractual deadlines to deliver a book every November...I personally don't feel like this is a valid justification for the startling decrease in pages and by extension, story.

Books_5,1,OR,"Why, oh why, do I keep on reading these! I have to chalk it up to sentiment, and perhaps the slim hope that a new ghostwriter will revive this once-charming series.

Simply put, this is a mess. There is the usual check-in with the mob of Pickax residents from earlier books, most of whom make brief and baffling appearances with little or no relation to the plot. The residents of this decidedly odd town - 400 miles north of reality - show up in droves for bookstore openings, stultifyingly dull lectures and amateur theatricals. (Thank god they seem to have given up eating pasties at every opportunity.)

The cats are little more than furniture these days, with Yum Yum barely making an appearance. Polly now manages a bookstore, but remains her snobby, charmless self. Qwill seems to have become the town errand boy, and, of course, pounds his mustache to a fare-thee-well.

The plot? It almost looked as though there would be one this time. But the reader is drawn in, only to be cruelly disappointed by an ending that lacks, well... an ending.

Go back and read the first three or four in the series, especially before Qwill moved to Pickax. They were certainly light reading, but the plots were intriguing, the writing was tighter and the books then deserved their Best Seller status.",0

However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.
Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing. Please take no notice to the malevolence of the quazi-sensitive and humourless French and Germans who negatively reviewed this charming and engaging work.

I would say it was one of the best novels I ever read - period. I read it many years ago, decades, in fact. I could do no more than give a general synopsis, though usually I don't bother when others have anyway. But, if you put a copy in my hand today, I would read it again. The fact that she was not aware of certain evidence or relied on evidence that we would now perhaps think not so persuasive is irrelevant. Most detective novels are far more unrealistic than this one, which is at least steeped in history. I read some of the negative comments, as I almost always do when I loved a book. Generally speaking, it gives the impression that some people who are uninterested or uninformed by history were bored by the book. But, note that over 80% of reviewers gave it 4 or more stars and over 90% 3 or more. That's pretty good. This is not a Reacher novel (and I like them) and the protagonist is bedridden, so don't expect action. It is a mental adventure and she succeeded wildly.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Is this a great novel, or just a great read? That's the question I ask myself before writing this review.  Right now, I can't answer the question.  For me, only time and another read or two will lean me towards one or the other.  I am content now in saying it was a great read,  I really did enjoy it.  Like many, I read through quickly.  The imagery was clear, striking and gripping.  While there was little complex plot to speak of - it didn't need one.  In a world such as that, life becomes simple and difficult, that's how the story was presented.

I question some of the decisions by the father, but he's not meant to be infallible, just human.  His identity and former life are meaningless in such a world, and he is left anonymous, which I truly appreciate.  I can also appreciate the risk the boy took at the end - how difficult would it be to carry on alone?

I can't yet give the book five stars, and wavered between three and four, but it's entirely possible that as the years go by and I pick this one up again, I may appreciate it more.  Given the time it takes to read, it's worthwhile for just about anyone.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I was somewhat hesitant to read this book because I feared the language used by the author would be too distracting.  However, the story itself is so engrossing that my worries were needless (and undoubtedly the language itself is necessary to create the unique voice of Saba).  This novel is about Saba and her journey to recover her twin brother, Lugh, after he is kidnapped from their home at Silverlake.  Saba is very close with her twin brother and puts him on a pedestal...he is the light to her dark.  When the reader first encounters Lugh, he is a father-like figure, taking care of the day-to-day needs of Saba, their father, and their younger sister, Emmi.  Although Saba is very close with her brother, she does not care for her younger sister, Emmi.  She views Emmi as a weak, distracting child, who only gets in the way.  Once Lugh is kidnapped, Saba begins her quest to recover her brother and  quickly learns that she is a fighter who will do anything to protect her family.  Along the way, she also meets Jack and a gang of revolutionary girls called the Free Hawks.  We watch how she grows as a person and learns the importance of family and friends.

So many touches are just right; the rat as Betraying Woman, the nocturni as Supernatural Advisors, etc., etc. The nocturni are especially nice, but many of her other features, for me, kind of creak. They're a bit familiar. Need to pass through three chambers to rescue someone? Gee, who's had to do that recently? Since L.

But we do want it to be fresh. And The Spindlers just doesn't feel very fresh. Or authentic. Our hero was just...too nice.

Books_5,5,OR,"I finished reading Everyday Zen today, and I will say that reading the book has been a very enjoyable experience.  Furthermore, I can already see some of the concepts and ideas presented in the book sinking in and making a difference in the way I approach my life.  The author makes it a point to repeat some of the most important concepts, sometimes you may noticed that what is being talked about you already read, and I think that this is critical for us to keep the important lessons in mind.

In Everyday Zen, the author makes it a point to communicate in plain English.  Sometimes this is done using little stories, sometimes by sharing some experiences, and sometimes in the form of dialogues the author has had with Zen students.  What I found most valuable is that, because of these explanations I could clearly see how the zen philosophy could directly affect my life.  Right away I was moving through my day and when fear, or anger, or plain sadness would start getting to me I would take the opportunity to think about the lessons learned by the book and apply them to the situation.  Quite useful!

Books_5,2,OR,"Let me preface this review with noting that I absolutely LOVE books where a dog or animals are the main or central character.

The Art of Racing in the Rain is nothing more than the political, social and anti-science commentary of the author who disguises such as being told or observed by Enzo, the dog in the book. I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially given the many rave reviews this book garnered, but I was highly disappointed with many aspects of this book.

Analogies to racing (automobile) are exceptionally redundant, and the characters were, I thought, not well developed in the least. The story plods along with Enzo seeing the world through his eyes (and the shortcomings of not possessing thumbs), which had promise; but unfortunately the author uses the canine as an outlet for his own political and social commentary.

Yes, there were a few chuckles throughout, but sadly, the book is more a success of exceptional marketing rather than exceptional writing or storytelling.

As mentioned, I love books where the dog or animals are the main character(s): If Only I Could Talk, White Fang, The Call of the Wild, The Wind in the Willows and many others. Unfortunately, The Art of Racing in the Rain, although it held promise, falls very short if you are a fan of these types of books.",0

The only parts of the book I detested or thought it added little value to the book was the mother parts. I thought it got in the way of an interesting read. He also talks to his brother in this book but it doesnt add up to much. It was overly long and drawn out..it seems like half the book is about the mom. My only thought on this book is that could have been a lot shorter. The book really dragged on for me. Most of the Jack Reacher novels feature fist fights, guns and a mystery. Good stuff. This one sadly has the focus on the mother. Their are some fights and some gun play but most of it is just emotions. I also felt like the very last end was kind of cop out.

Though a bit more focused in plot than ""Magician,"" Feist follows the formulas used in the earlier books,  devoting most of his energy to action narrative in which the characters  remain caricatured stereotypes all too familiar to fans of the genre.  His  cast of characters neglects none of the usual inhabitants of the fantasy  realm, ranging from elves and goblins to dragons and pirates, as well as  the inclusion of samurai (The Tsurani), Moslem warriors from the era of  Saladin (The Empire of Kesh), and here ewoks thinly disguised as  ""gwali.""

The good guys, even when rascally  criminals, are brave and true and, after much hardship, their defeat of  evil is assured.  All in all, a storyline that could have been lifted from  a D&D script.  I continue to find a lack of weight or substance to the  tales, and harbor some doubts that the ""Riftwar Saga"" will  eventually devolve into a series of repetitive, banal quests.

Books_5,4,OR,"Okay, as a reviewer of Sally Bedell Smith's new biography, ""Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of An Improbable Life"", am I judging the book or it's subject? This is a question I ask myself when I review any biography, particularly one of a controversial figure, like a politician or a royal figure, etc. In this case, it's sort of a toss-up; the book is well-written and the subject has gone through his life, making both bad and good decisions. These decisions - based often on whim and fancy - affect a fair number of people, pigs, and plants, and will continue to affect them, after he assumes the throne upon his 91 year old mother's death.

Bedell Smith's bio is just one of many that have been written about Charles over the years, along with the lot on other royal figures, particularly Diana. In the past, these bios have been heavily slanted during the Windsor marriage - Team Charles or Team Diana - but this one is drawn very even handily. The only problem with this book is that if you're a Royal Watcher, you've probably already read parts of this book ten times already under other titles, written by other authors.

Books_5,3,OR,"Well, I struggled a bit to write this review and I really wanted to give it 4 stars. But I couldn't in the end because I don't think that would be comparing ""Devil's Dream"" fairly to Bell's ""All Souls Rising"", a novel I find the richer and more moving of the two, and the novel to which I would attribute 4-5 stars.

""Devil's..."" is all in all a very entertaining, original and informative read. The story of Nathan Bedford Forrest is a truly fascinating one, and some of the literary tools Bell uses (i.e. the bits of ""magical realism"") add to that fascination . Some of the events in the first half of the novel regarding Forrest's family are powerfully done, e.g.the affairs Forrest had are described in a interesting, non-moralistic, human way; the death of his daughter is devastating..

But in the end, the constant chronological swings tired me. After loving the first 250 pages of the novel, I virtually flipped through the last 50. My sense was that what was described in those last pages had already happened earlier in the book (e.g. another horse shot dead from under Forrest after another heroic charge...). I had also grown tired at this point of trying to decipher Forrest's tennessee accent.

I remain an admirer of Smartt Bell. But ""All Souls Rising"" will provide readers a better experience of his talent",0
Books_5,5,OR,"THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three stories that all center on the narrator: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young Korean cellist.  Each story has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most important - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such informed authority that imagining the author in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a thorough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at reportage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason for writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.  Well worth anyone's time.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"I have never read anything about this author before, and I have to say that I was delighted with his work. I enjoyed this novel a lot, and it gave me a good glimpse of what life can be for a well-off older couple in modern Israel. How they cope with everyday life, family issues, death, mourning, separation, etc. It was a slow read, but not boring at all. It all happens during an eight-day holiday; Hanukkah. And with the lighting of each candle we get to see how the past and present of this family unfolds.

However, I would have liked to know more of some characters, like the couple's son and daughter, for example, or the grandfather, but you still get some hints as to what their lives are like. You can pretty much put the puzzle together, or develop the characters in your mind any way you want. After all the story revolves around the married couple, Daniela and Amotz, who by the way make a nice couple. The brother in law, Yirmiyahu, is so mysterious and obscure, that you get hooked with him trying to unravel his mind and feelings. Africa seems then the appropriate setting for this man, and all that surrounds him enhances the mystery. And he does spice the book a lot.

Andre and Devon are wonderful characters with great chemistry when they are in the throws of passion.  But, on the other side of that Devon starts out strong and fearless then turns to ""Andre"" mush and then fearless again.  It isn't very consistant.  Then there is Andre, who is a super hot French captian, but is just a brute!!!  There are times he is a head strong man ready to dive in and save the day, and other times he is simply a donkey's butt!

The plot is a strong one, untill we get to the island, then it is rushed alittle.  That is when the story becomes ok for me.  The ending ties up all loose ends, but not very engaging.

The other charachters in this book (Minter, for one) are really great.  I was hoping the second book was about him.

So, basically there were somethings I didn't like about the book, but the bulk of the book was good.  There is some love scenes, so beware if you are looking for clean romance.  (They are tasteful as far as passion goes)

However, Babe Ruth figures into the story only tangentially as a means of helping to set the stage--Boston, as WWI is drawing to a close, and Prohibition is on its way. This book is a nice blend of fact and fiction, and the facts are more engrossing than the fiction. Boston at that time was a city in trouble, anxious to blame just about everything on the Communists, except perhaps the flu epidemic, and by the end I felt as if that had happened a couple of books ago. The family histrionics are fairly predictable, with the bad son (Connor), the good son (Danny, our hero), and the young son (Joe). Of course, Mom and Dad have their heads in the sand and think that the good son is really the bad son and vice versa. There's also Eddie, who came over on the boat from Ireland with Dad and is evil personified. Dad and Eddie are cops on the take, and Danny, also a cop, gets involved with unionizing the police force.

Here is a remark made by Ben Jackson, a professor of a professor at Stanford: Religious Studies at Stanford University put it:
""Is this a sad tale? Well, it is sad in the same way that life is sad. We are all needy, and, if we are lucky and any good, we grow old using others and getting used up. Tears fall in our lives like leaves from a tree. Our finitude is not something to be regretted or despised, however; it is what makes giving (and receiving) possible. The more you blame the boy, the more you have to fault human existence. The more you blame the tree, the more you have to fault the very idea of parenting. Should the tree's giving be contingent on the boy's gratitude? If it were, if fathers and mothers waited on reciprocity before caring for their young, then we would all be doomed. ""

I have been reading Nevada Barr's books for many years now and have been disappointed in the dark turn this series has taken. I absolutely loved the earlier books in this series, which could never be accused of being ""cozies"", but included wonderful descriptions of National Parks and a variety of realistic characters. I thought the premise of this story being a story of survival sounded intriguing, so I gave it a try. After finishing the book, I can say I liked it better than recent installments such as ""The Rope"", but didn't like it nearly as well as earlier books in this series.

I liked the vivid characterizations of the female characters and descriptions of the setting, but the male villains are interchangeable and their actions are appalling. Having the story told from different points of view added some interest, but also added redundancy and slowed the pace of the book. Some may enjoy this as a story of good vs. evil, but it's not my kind of story and even the great character of Anna Pigeon couldn't save it for me.

Books_5,3,OR,"The first few chapters were very hard to get through, because they described a lot of  domination and brutality. It was hard to read how the Normans and Vikings treated these women and innocent servants. I'm not a big fan of rape in romance novels (although I seem to remember it being popular in the 70's) but it is historically accurate. I didn't like Wulfgar forcing the heroine to have sex with him. It was very difficult for me to like him after that. He treats her so badly that it's abusive, and I didn't warm up to him until towards the late middle of the story.

There's a lot of melodrama in this novel. At times Aislinn seems bi-polar, swinging back and forth between rage and happiness within one scene. Her mother acts so hysterical and goofy she's unbelievable. The female villains are horrible but it was kind of fun reading about them.

The language the author uses is meant to sound medieval, and at times it was hard to follow what the characters were saying. It got a little formal and flowery at times, and slowed the story down for me.

Books_5,4,OR,"Mr. Carroll has written an interesting book.  I read this book in a matter of days, a sure sign it never got boring. I disagreed with Mr. Carroll constantly, but still give the book a  high rating.  I came away from the book finding Mr. Carroll to be phony. A man rebelling against an overbearing father by entering the Priesthood, a vocation he was completely unfit for. He showed no respect for his vocation at the seminary where he and his fellow seminarians cursed their directors and teachers. He was ordained and became a professional protester, I don't recall him performing many priestly duties, but he sure did a lot of protesting against the Vietnam War. He did seem to realize he wasn't Priestly material soon after the war ended. I find it amazing how many seminarians and young Priests seemed to lose their Priestly vocation after the war ended and they were in no danger of being drafted.  I did find his father to be overbearing and abrasive at times, but it always seemed that his father was the one reaching out to reconcile with his son. Mr. Carroll is always right and dear ole dad is always wrong, I think he should have evaluated himself and looked more closely at his father's points of view before writing this book. It must feel good knowing you have never been wrong.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Having watched RAI's Montalbano television series (with Luca Zingaretti's outstanding performances as the eccentric inspector), I was expecting to find the novels familiar and boring. Not at all, not in the least. The TV series excel in giving us the visual feel of the exteriors: the superb cast of delightful characters; and the beauty of Camilleri's fictional town of ""Vigta"" in the fictional district of ""Montelusa"" (actually the Sicilian city of Ragusa, Italy, and surrounding towns). The novels give us what TV cannot, the interiors, the feelings and cogitations of the uniquely unpredictable Montalbano and the reactions of those around him. As Montalbano's faithful (and unusually astute) detective, Fazio, says to himself in ""The Snack Thief,"" his boss didn't become insane, he was insane from birth. The novels reinforce TV's visual charm and delicious performances with the ""insides"" of the plots, people, and places. In many ways, ""Voice of the Violin"" is the most noir of the series--plot and counter-plot turn the unraveling into a delicious concerto of criminality. One can hear the gears and the arpeggios whirling about in Salvo brain. Camilleri's novels are such a delight to read, I imagine Montalbano's police force colleagues, friends and lovers, even his opponents (criminal and bureaucratic), who lived the plots with him, would enjoy these books. And Montalbano? He'd read the novels and then ask Camilleri, half-serious, half-mocking, ""So, why are you always busting my balls?""",0

Books_5,4,OR,"This is an excellently written book - fast paced and engaging. Jon Krakauer is adept at interweaving the history of the LDS Church with a present day story of ""violent faith"".

Based on a ""revelation"" he received from God, Ron Lafferty and his brother Dan brutally murdered Brenda Lafferty (their sister-in-law) and her 15-month old daughter, Erica. The two brothers never spoke of having remorse for what they did. In fact, Dan openly admits to the murder, claiming God wanted him to do it. It is a haunting notion: that someone's thoughts could be so twisted as to let them believe that by killing another human being they were doing the work of God. Krakauer latches onto this idea and examines exactly what would lead a person to commit murder in present day America because of religious believe.

Though the topic is fascinating, it is important to keep in mind that Krakauer only focuses on the extreme parts of Mormonism. He talks about Fundamentalists who openly practice polygamy and the physical and sexual abuse that goes on in those communities. Not all Mormon's are polygamists and not all Mormon's actively seek ""blood atonement"" against their enemies; it is only a small percentage that is so extreme. Before judging all Mormons too harshly remember, every religion has its radicals. Therefore if you do decide to pick up ""Under the Banner of Heaven"", read it with a grain of salt.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"I haven't read the previous two books in this series but I was able to follow this story with no problems and fall in love with the Hurley family. I really loved this book. Theres something incredible appealing about second chances. I can honestly say its hard for me to review this book, because I can relate to part of it. My parents got divorced when I was 6, they never got back together because my mom moved on and thats totally ok because they were kind of awful together. I can understand that sometimes great things happen to people at the wrong moments, sometimes were just not ready to appreciate it, to cherish it. That was my dads case and thats probably why I understand all the background of this book and why I was moved by it.
Lauren Dane wrote a real touching story. I really loved Kelly, her relationship with her daughters and I liked that Vaughan was determined to do everything to get his family back. The only but here is that, from my point of view, Kelly fell into the relationship a little fast even though she made him work to prove that he changed. I will probably go back to read the first two books in this series and I would love to read a book about Kellys best friend, Stacey!

The defendants are often not charged with the crime, but the prosecutor is charged with it.  The prosecution team is a group of detectives from the FBI who investigate the crime.  They are sent to a small town in Ohio to investigate the case.  There they investigate the case and uncover the evidence.  The cases are prosecuted.  The case is eventually settled out of court for a sum of money.  The jurors are given a choice between guilty or innocent.  There is a sentence of six years in prison for the guilty defendant and five years for the innocent defendant.  The judge sentences the defendants to two years.  The case is eventually decided upon.  The jury decides whether the guilty defendant is guilty or not.  The trial is adjourned until the next trial.

Books_5,5,OR,"Having lived in a cave for the last decade or so, I confess I had no knowledge of Jeremy Wade and his ""River Monsters"" television show. Glancing at the 'New Books' section of my local library, I spotted RIVER MONSTERS..and I was hooked. I'm glad I happened to spot Wade's book; it's a fascinating and informative guide to freshwater beasties few people even knew existed.

For the past 20-odd years, Wade, a Brit zoologist with a touch of Indiana Jones thrown in, has been traipsing the globe, searching for legendary freshwater fish. In RIVER MONSTERS, he shares the results of his quest and the results are eye-openers. Wade's descriptions of his efforts to find, fish for and land goliath tigerfish, arapaima, goonch, ripsaw catfish and longfin eels are wonderfully exciting, excitement only topped by the wonder of seeing actual photographs of those - often humungous - creatures. Along the way, Wade imparts valuable information on his finny friends and how they, in some cases, acquired fearsome if undeserved reputations as man-killers.

Yet, exciting as Wade's adventures are, there is a cautionary note running throughout the book. Overfishing is taking its toll of fishlife, large and small, worldwide and Wade points out the fact that many of the freshwater beasties he tangled with are threatened with extinction.

In short, RIVER MONSTERS is an appealing, exciting and insightful guide to aquatic wonders that - may still - lurk in freshwater rivers. Recommended.",0
Books_5,3,OR,"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

Books_5,5,OR,"In his later years, Welles often complained that he spent more time trying to find money to make films than he did actually making films. And seeing Welles still scrambling for cash in his last days as a commercial pitchman for such products as Dark Tower and Paul Masson Wines (""Where we will sell no wine before it's time""), you know he was right.
This entertaining and exhaustive book by Simon Callow doesn't deal with most of his film career - only covering up to 1941. (We're still waiting on part two to cover the rest. Simon? Simon?). However, what it does do is clear up much of Welles' confusing past (he often told conflicting stories in interviews) and delve into the two main works that set Welles up for stardom...and the fall...in Hollywood - The War of the Worlds radio broadcast and Citizen Kane. And no wonder they were sharpening knives for the boy wonder when Welles publicly put down the Hollywood community, his Kane script bit the hand that feeds him by taking obvious shots at newspaper mogul Randolph Hearst and he was given the kind of directorial freedom veteran directors could only dream of.
Some people may tire of reading about Welles' theatre days with Houseman, anxiously waiting to get to the meat of his film career. But to understand why Welles became a ""has-been"" at 26 and the long slide to come, this is required reading.",0

Prudence was a great heroine. She was resilient and stronger than she gave herself credit for. She was definitely likable and I thought she was lovely.

John was wonderful as well. Sweet and protective over his loved ones. He was definitely chivalrous, determined to not only protect the women in his life, but also teach them to protect themselves. He definitely had some secrets that I didn't expect. He was just great and I really liked him as well.

The romance was delightful. Prudence and John were perfect together. I loved how John help Prudence be more confident in herself and move past what happened to her during her first Season. Their romance was both sweet and spicy and I thought they were great together.

The plot was fast paced and I was hooked the entire way through. There were definitely a few surprises along the way that I never saw coming. I really enjoyed the story and the ending was perfect.

In general, I won't read a book unless it's rated 4 stars and above.  I really enjoyed this book.  The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that I realize that this is not a book for many people.  I enjoyed Harold's ride of life through the book.  I thought he became a pretty good person despite his background and the bad things that happen to him in the book. I think his sex life is totally unbelievable but since I thought this book was filled with comedy, I took the sex sequences as part of the comedy.  I enjoyed the Nixon side of the book because I was around during his presidency and the mess he made of it.  I liked how Harold's life just grew around him, almost without him trying, because he was basically a nice guy.  Most families have some type of dysfunction in them and Harold's family has plenty.  However, who would not care for a sick brother or sick mother?  Who would not care for the other characters that come into Harold's life.

This isn't a temporary situation--it's permanent and that makes it more scary.  Some of the family seems to accept it before others.

This last book was better than the second one, which I didn't love as much as the first one.  Miranda's voice is back but it is much more despairing and hopeless.  The love development between the Alex and Miranda didn't feel real--it felt very artificial and forced.

If you have nothing to do some afternoon, or are on a flight from NYC to Chicago with a Philly layover, you could do worse. I suppose.  I will give Heller the latitude to play with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure in the narration, until it becomes clear the narrator is an English major with literary pretensions doing a self-conscious and bad Hemingway imitation. That part is just painful.

Ok, most of this novel has a brisk plot, so WTH not play along?

Books_5,5,OR,"Wallace Thurman was an influential figure in the Harlem Renaissance, the era of heightened creativity in writing, art and music that arose in Harlem following World War I. In Thurman's short life he wrote novels, plays, poems and essays and started two magazines. A bohemian who drank and partied hard, he died at age thirty-two of tuberculosis.

The Blacker the Berry, first published in 1929, gives a fascinating picture of Harlem in the 1920s with its vibrant street life, easy sex, wild house-rent parties and black cabarets frequented by thrill-seeking whites.

The story follows the many tribulations of young Emma Lou Morgan. The tragedy of her life is not being black, but too black. Her light-skinned mother is ashamed of her dark-skinned daughter.

An alien in her own family, Emma Lou is universally snubbed in her hometown of Boise, Idaho, where high browns and half whites rule Negro society. Even at college in Los Angeles, the colored sorority won't have her. Harlem is her last chance to find a haven from the color snobbery within her own race.

Emma Lou, however, brings her troubles with her wherever she goes, for she too is a color snob. She'll fall for a light-colored good-for-nothing over an intelligent black man every time. Emma Lou's experiences make painful reading at times, but eventually open her eyes and give her new hope.

Books_5,5,OR,"Joyce's ""Dubliners"" is a collection of fifteen short stories that present snapshots of the lives of common people in  Dublin around the beginning of the 20th Century.  The stories are subtle commentaries about  Irish attitudes towards nationalism, religion, morality, life, and death.  Each explores a distinctive, dramatic theme, such as sexual perversion  (""An Encounter""), infatuation (""Araby""), the  frustration of personal unfulfillment (""A Little Cloud"" and  ""Counterparts""), self-imposed loneliness (""A Painful  Case""), hubris (""A Mother""), and Catholic/Protestant  conflict (""Grace"").  Overtones of Irish nationalism, remembrance,  and piety permeate all the stories.
The stories are neither  depressing nor uplifting, but rather  open-ended in their denouement; no  conflicts are resolved and no moral conclusions are reached.  Joyce depicts  the characters and scenes so sympathetically that the reader understands  clearly why the dejected boy in ""Araby"" leaves the bazaar feeling  like  ""a creature driven and derided by vanity"" and the events  that drive Farrington to beat his young son at the end of  ""Counterparts.""  And why, in ""The Dead,"" Gabriel, after  giving a dinner speech in which he makes respectful reference to the dead,  feels his dignity knocked down a notch when his wife reveals to him the  tragic fate of her past love.
After nearly a century,  ""Dubliners"" remains one of the best  crystallizations of humanity  bestowed upon the world.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Nothing to Lose is vintage Jack Reacher.  This time he's in Colorado, heading to San Diego from Calais, Maine.  The locals there pronounce it 'callous' and that speaks to part of Jack's character, the part that arises when he's challenged unnecessarily.  The 'challenger' here is Despair, CO, a few miles from Hope, CO, a few miles from Halfway, CO.  Despair is a company town.  It's also a pivotal element of the classic western plot in which the hero stumbles upon a boondock town in which everyone, especially the law, conspires against him.  The law in this case tells Jack to depart, forthwith, and for no apparent reason.  Jack is not one to follow irrational orders, particularly from individuals with no authority over him, and he sets out to discover the secret(s) of Despair, with the help of a policewoman from Hope.

Lee Child's new novel points up his almost unique ability to take a simple plot with simple elements and turn it into a compelling, irresistibly insistent narrative.  By the time we reach the end we discover that things are far less simple than they appear.  They are also a bit too complex for plausibility's sake, but by then we are caught up in the wave and are carried to the powerful conclusion.

Another strong outing for Jack.  While perhaps not his strongest, it is stronger than whatever's in second place.  Highly recommended.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"Benedict and Yeager describe a vast array of criminal patterns of dozens  of current and former NFL players -- including some hideous and barbaric  acts for which certain players suffered far too little (if any!) jail time.  Because of the variety and brutality of the crimes described, more than  the quality of the writing itself, the book is riveting reading; although  there is a strongly sensationalistic, tabloid-style undercurrent to the  whole piece which may repulse more careful readers.  I finished this book  with three outstanding impressions:
1) Far too little attention is given  to the successful redemption of specific players who have stopped their  criminal ways and become solid, admirable citizens (e.g.,  ""Hollywood"" Henderson or Cris Carter);
2) The writes make a  convincing argument that the pampering which star players recieve in late  childhood immunizes them (in their minds) from consequences for their  actions; and
3) The authors clearly intended to be shocking at least as  much for their own fame and fortune as for any noble social reform.  After  all, these criminal records are public, and were already well documented in  the popular sports media.

It really didn't feel dystopian at all. There were still the big problems of war and incurable disease, but the characters still had hope, which made the biggest difference.

I LOVED all the characters! The good guys were good, the bad guys were bad, and the stepmother remained in the middle of the two. I don't want to say that they felt unrealistic, but they weren't completely realistic either. Except for Cinder, all the characters felt like they were slight caricatures of their true selves. This wasn't a bad thing, though. It just made it kind of easier to point out ""Oh, he's prince charming! And that's the evil person! Oh, and don't forget the fairy god-droid!""

I know everyone's been talking about that really predictable plot twist. Yeah--it was predictable. And knowing beforehand that there was a predictable twist like that meant that the first time it was even mentioned I totally figured it out.
Luckily, that didn't take away from the story at all! The plot never lost excitement, and kept me on my toes throughout it all!

I passed this book up actually, the first time I saw it. It seemed like a book for younger audiences, and it is, but when I picked it up a month or so later (peer pressure's a serious bitch) I found it entertaining myself. It tells the story of Nobody Owens, a toddler who escapes to a graveyard when his family is murdered, and follows him up to his teenage years. He's raised by the ghosts who live in the cemetery and has a variety of adventures involving ghouls, a werewolf, a dead witch, a dance between the living and the dead and more. Most of the chapters in the middle of the book could be stand-alone short (and bedtime) stories. The end of the book, Nobody's confrontation with his family's killer, is over about as quick as it begins, and that's a bit jarring, but forgiveable because that's not what the book is supposed to be about anyhow.

While all of the stories revolve in some way around parasitic characters, only a few of them are the classic warm-thick-blood-sex vampire erotica.  Most of the stories are at least creepy, and a few are quite scary.

As wth any collection of short stories, not every story will be to every person's taste, as you can see from the reviews here.  In particular, the story ""The Dripping of Sundered Wineskins"" seems to elicit a love-it-or-hate-it opinion.  Personally I loved it.  I enjoyed all of the straight vampire tales, especially, of course, Neil Gaiman's excellent opening tale, ""Snow, Glass, Apples"".  Other notable vampire stories were ""Ceilings and Sky"", Whispers in Walled Tombs"", ""First Date"", and ""Bloodlight.""

Unfortunately, though, there are several stories I hated, too.  ""Armies of the Heart"" was one, and I really, really hated ""When Memory Fails"" and ""The Fly Room.""  Eyeball-sucking?

I've been looking for ""Matilda"" because my mom had read it and she loved it! My mom is a good judge of books so I wanted to read it.

So I checked out the book and ran to the car so I could go to my grandma's house and read it. I had a bursting feeling in side of me. I felt ready to explode! When the car pulled into the driveway and parked, I burst out of the car and ran inside my grandma's house, flopped down on my favorite chair and started reading ""Matilda.""

The character Matilda is a genius girl with idiot parents who are always yelling and raging at her for no reason! With Matilda's magic powers she pays back her parents and has a fun time driving them crazy.

But things at school are different. The hated headmistress the Trunchbull is no match for Matilda and her magic powers. Miss Honey has a loving heart and trusts Matilda with her biggest secret.

This book is extremely funny and mysterious. After I finished this genius book, and my mom knew I loved it, she got me the movie! The movie is good, but not nearly as good as the book. You should see the movie and read the book! They're both wonderful.  -by Eliza (a student in msdu's class)",0

Books_5,5,OR,"Chasing Lilacs is an impressive debut novel for author Carla Stewart. The author takes us back to 1958 and puts us in a small Texas community, and into the mind and heart of Sammie Tucker, an almost thirteen-year-old girl.

Life isn't as simple as you think it must have been ""back then."" Sammie's mother suffers with mental issues, and when she commits suicide, Sammie's world is filled with loss and confusion. Then her disgruntled aunt shows up to help ""care"" for Sammie, and things get even messier. It's a good thing that Sammie has a loving father - not to mention other townspeople who look out for her. There's her outspoken best friend, a new boy who comes to live with his uncle, and her mentors - the woman next door who raises birds, and an elderly widower who has his own secrets.

Although Sammie is a young teen, I became totally involved with the character. This story pulled me in emotionally, while it also provided surprising plot twists. I was whisked into nostalgia and a time when life was perhaps a bit slower, but the pace of the story kept me turning the pages.

Chasing Lilacs touches on the subject of mental illness and shock treatments. Not necessarily a happy topic. But is also an uplifting story of hope and forgiveness. It reminds us that even when we don't initially see it - God is still in control and working on our behalf.

I'm looking forward to reading Carla Stewart's next release.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I have to say it's been years since I have felt so engaged reading a book.  Oddly, I saw the movie before buying the Kindle book; and in the middle of reading, I decided to watch the movie again.  I suspect it won't be long and I will read the book once again.

This is a thinking person's book and story, and thus isn't for everyone.  But the mastery of the writing is so highly evocative that you ""see"" the book as you read it.  Incredibly deep characters, mesmerizing continuity of theme (which some might argue about, given that the book is written as segments contributing to a ""writ large"" story), the ability to make you laugh, cry and inevitably sigh, ""yes.""

I had never heard of David Mitchell before reading this book.  But it only took me 500+ pages to realize what an important writer and artistic voice he is.

I am a strong supporter of public libraries, and have downloaded Kindle versions of books to determine if I will actually buy the book.  In the case of Cloud Atlas, it was a no-brainer.  I finished Cloud Atlas today and immediately downloaded ""Ghostwritten"" from my local library.  I suspect it won't be long and my Kindle cloud will have all of his works in it.

Books_5,4,OR,"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

Books_5,3,OR,"As a reader who is not an aficionado of speculative fiction or alternative historical fiction, this novel left me rather perplexed. Having read Robert Harris Fatherland a number of years ago (and having enjoyed it) and spurred by the popularity of the Amazon TV series inspired by Dicks novel, I dove in.

Set in an alternate post-WWII America that has been divided by the victorious Japanese and Nazis, the narrative focuses on five or six characters whose stories never quite coalesce; the fragmented narrative structure in itself is not necessarily a flaw (plenty of good novels feature fragmented narratives), but in Dicks novel, it definitely creates a lack of coherence that ultimately enervates the novel. More than half the book is devoted to exposition, but the payoffwhich doesnt really emerge until the final three chapters or so, once again in very fragmented fashionfeels uncertain and anticlimactic. Complicating matters is a novel within the novel, an alternate history that presumes the Allies had won the war but is itself different from the actual historical record (e.g., FDR did not serve four terms as President). Excerpts from this novel, called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, along with the I Ching, which every character seems to consult for guidance, appear throughout the story, yet again these elements fail to add any sort of coherence to the narrative.

Perhaps my lack of expertise in this genre handicaps my appreciation of this novel (which did, after all, win the Hugo Award), but I was, in the end, disappointed.",0

The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a group of young women who are going to kill him.  The young woman is a fourteen-year-old girl, and the group of women is so obsessed with killing her that they have to take her away from her.  They all have plans to kill her, and they all get together.  The story starts out fairly straightforward, with a young woman in a wheelchair being abducted and killed.  She doesn't have a lot of tools, but she is a fairly skilled fighter and she does a good job of keeping herself safe.  She's also a very clever, intelligent woman, and the group of women are quite good at making sure that the children are safe, too.  I really liked that the group of women were mostly young people, but they also had a lot of good qualities, such as being very intelligent and strong, so they would be very able to handle situations, and they were a bit stubborn about it.

Books_5,3,OR,"Like any film instructor, I'm always seeking an affordable text for my students. With the average text hovering around $80.00 (and then the additional charge for supplemental books), The Lean Forward Moment seemed like a steal. I say ""seemed"" because like many reviewers here, I'm a bit confused as to whom the target-audience is.

The simple, jargon-free language appeals to the lay-person (which is always welcome in texts geared toward the masses); however, the structure and more advanced concepts give the feel of an academic text. The Lean Forward Moment seems stuck in a perplexing gray-zone. While I feel Hollyn was attempting to please both audiences, he may have (accidentally) alienated both. Curious.

I know that it seems superficial, but one of the ways I evaluate the potential success of a film-text, is through its examples. I know (for a fact) that my students excitedly scan a text ... looking for stills from works they know/love. The Lean Forward moment uses many popular (and technically masterful) examples. The Matrix, Finding Nemo, 300, Lord of the Rings, The Godfather -- all good choices to get the cinema-neonate involved. On the flip side, Across the Universe, Brazil, Synecdoche, Contempt, Coons, Jack in the Box, Satacracy 88 -- these niche/obscure works are interesting to more advanced students (maybe). (And, now we're back to that gray-zone ...).

Here's my professional opinion, The Lean Forward Moment is fantastic for the intermediate student who knows the fundamentals, will be entertained by familiar examples, and is curious about lesser known works.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Months ago, Farrah Langley and Xavier Kane engaged in a hot affair that last nearly a year. Upon a chance meeting in New York, the two run into one another and sparks still fly between Xavier and Farrah. As the two rekindle their relationship, Xavier realizes that the chemistry between them is more than just sex. Will Xavier be able to convince Farrah that they are perfect for one another?

Bachelor Unleashed is an enjoyable read. The sex scenes were scorching and incredibly vivid. The author took care to give incredibly descriptive scenes of New York that made me feel as if I were there with the two characters. However, it was odd that Ms. Jackson didn't devote the same amount of description to her main characters.

Bachelor Unleashed by Brenda Jackson is the second book I have read from this author. As this is a series, I would strongly urge the reader to read the first book, Bachelor Untamed. I greatly enjoyed the characters but felt left out as I didn't truly comprehend the significance of certain minor characters. Despite those minute misgivings, I thoroughly enjoyed the chemistry between the two main characters. I couldn't help but rooting for Xavier as he ruthlessly courted Farrah. I feel that Ms. Jackson writes wonderful characters and has a talent for writing brilliant settings that I must visit one day soon.  Being well satisfied by Ms. Jackson's writing, I look forward to reading another story by her in the future.

I was unsure if I would benefit from this book. After all, I don't really have any enemies, not in the human form anyway. But i do at times battle addiction, fear, anxiety, depression... would this book help me understand God's purpose for our own internal struggles?

The answer is yes. Anything you face - any person, any struggle, any weakness - may feel like an enemy. But sometimes your enemy is your best opportunity. ALL things work together for good! God may use an enemy to bring about your great purpose & destiny. But it is all worth it in the end!

Life can be hard. It seems like we have barely made it through one battle, when we're facing another. But this book is a great encouragement & testimony to the fact that God is with us & sees us face our enemies. He knows, and it isn't him punishing or being angry with us! He is actually just using these trials to promote us to the next level.

I think this book was well-written. I also liked how it was broken down into short chapters. It made it seem like an easier read that way!

Brother is universal and appealing to all. Maybe because as children of Cain, we are all the same - A blend of Good and Bad. Wow!!
East of Eden was heavy for me!!
Steinbeck is so good at descriptions - love the style of writing, the dry subtle humor- the very fact that he does not justify his character's actions - the struggle of mankind, the inner conflict,is so beautifully portrayed.
The Theme: Brother vs. Brother
The Plot:  Two Families in Salinas, California. The Trasks and the Hamiltons. Adam Trask who faces a life-long complex from his brother Charles Trask heads towards a new life - with his brand-new wife. The birth of his twins is a joyous moment only to result in a sad one - with Kathy (his wife) walking out on
him.
He raises the kids with his manservant Lee - the ever symbolical of what is right - Chinese - who is a great human character in ages to come.
The twins - Aron and Cal are poles apart and the rest is as they say ""History"".
The Hamiltons are a different breed altogether. Nine children and Samuel Hamilton is a man who never feels the need to have more money.

All I Want for Christmas is a Duke is an anthology about women who fall in love with dukes and their love is finally returned around Christmas time.
The first story The Duke and Duchess Trap reminded me of the Parent Trap story. The duke and duchess have twin girls and when they separate, each one takes a daughter. The girls meet a few years later in a boarding school. On Christmas break, they both return to the other parent. To get the correct daughter back, the parents must reunite.
Sophie and the Duke revolves around a duke looking for a wife by having a masked ball. He meets a childhood friend at the ball but he doesnt remember her right away. As time goes on, he gets a few clues as to who she is and realizes that she still intrigues him.
A scientific formula is the basis of The Dukes Christmas Wish. The Duke of Vale comes up with a marriage formula to get accepted into society, except he didn't figure love into the equation.
Lady Patience helps out a person stranded in a snowstorm in One Magic Season. Unbeknownst to her, it is an old flame of hers. But she cant leave him stranded to freeze. So she faces her fears and insecurities to offer him a place to stay until the storm abates.

Books_5,4,OR,"This is my second Kristan Higgins book, and while Ive long grown past reading straight-up romance novels  a staple of my jr. high and high school reading list  someone I trust recommended Higgins to me as smarter and more sarcastic than you average, cloying Harlequin formula and suggested I give her a try.

This is actually a sequel, of sorts, to The Best Man, the other Higgins novel I read, where it focuses on the romance of a side character from that novel in the same quirky upstate New York town. (Apparently, there are also several others featuring the same group of friends and family which Higgins has dubbed, The Blue Heron Series.)

Not quite as sharp as the Best Man, it did follow a similar path, with stubbornly single bar owner Colleen, who loves to set up everyone else, but resists falling in love herself after being badly burned by a former flame. And guess who happens to show up in Colleens bar one day? Yep, the one that got away, Lucas.

This isn't groundbreaking, and it gets to same destination as youd expect from a romance title, but Higgins does it with a lot more panache than your average rote, romance author. Witty dialogue, cliche-free conversation and a healthy dose of snark, all combined with a still sweet and, well, romantic romance.

Books_5,5,OR,"Having read and thoroughly enjoying Bernstein's earlier biography of Thomas Jefferson, I decided to give THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE REVOLUTION OF IDEAS, a look. Like his earlier work, this is a wonderful introduction to Jefferson, however this book is geared towards the school age reader. Much of the text is identical to the earlier biography. The most significant difference is the addition of dozens of illustrations, from portraits of Jefferson's friends, family, and foes, and political cartoons. My single knock on Bernstein's book is the same knock I had on his previous work. Bernstein adamantly portrays Jefferson as a ""strict separationist"", which in and of itself is accurate. However he fails to recognize that what constituted a ""strict separationist"" 200 years ago is much different than the definition given in today's climate of political correctness gone awry. Bernstein seems genuinely perplexed that Jefferson ""sent Christian missionaries to establish schools in western territories to educate Native Americans - and convert them to Christianity. "" As with extremists today, Bernstein fails to understand that Jefferson's actions did not violate the First Amendment in that ""Congress made no law respecting the establishment of religion. ""

I could spend all day writing about how mixed up people are about what the First Amendment means and how it was intended by our framers, but that strays from the subject at hand. All in all, this is a great introduction for school children and should capture their interest and perhaps, lead them into more indepth study of one of our greatest leaders. Monty Rainey

I have read many of the books by the author and was very impressed with this one.  It was very different from the other books I have read about war",1
Books_5,5,OR,"Jules Feiffer is characteristically hilarious in all of his books (like the Man in the Ceiling, for instance), however, this book is more than just hilarity. It is deceptively simple; simple in style, and simple in writing, but Feiffer teaches countless lessons in this book. However, instead of being preachy, he disguises them behind his singular style of ""funniness"". I could cite a hundred of these lessons. For instance, the ""Valley of Vengeance""; the villagers who thought of nothing but ""getting even"" with their neighbours, burning down their house and snatching their stuff. They lived in a veritable paradise but they never looked beyond harming their fellow man, and when Roger showed up as an eagle and introduced laughter and beauty, their lives changed, and they thought less about vengeance and more about harmony.
Also, it has its funny points (which are many), but it is also despairingly tragic at times. I read this book first when I was 8, and it was just a funny book, but having read it again at an older age (16), I understand even more than I saw before. So, if you get a chance, this book is a must.

Books_5,4,OR,"Polly Perks runs away disguised as a boy to join the Borogrovian army in order to search for her missing brother Paul, who joined up the year before.  She is one of a motley number of new recruits who include a vampire, a troll, an Igor, and seveal other rather strange people.  They are looked after by the mighty Sergeant Jackrum, who keeps a fatherly eye on them all.  Polly soon finds out that she is not the only recruit with something to hide, and learns the importance of an extra pair of socks.

She finds herself acting as batman to the nervous Lieutenant Blouse, who dreams of achieving glory by having an article of clothing or food named after him.  The war is going badly for Borogrovia, and the enemy are getting the upper hand, but then the recruits devise a cunning plan for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.  But Maladict the Vampire is having coffee withdrawl symptoms, and Wazzer is hearing voices in his head, and things are getting stranger all the time.

There are some good characters in this book, particularly the larger-than life Sergeant Jackrum, and some chracters from previous books pop up.  It's not quite as sombre as 'Night Watch', but it is a bit short on laughs compared to earlier Discworld novels, there are some funny bits, but they are rather few and far between.  This is a good book, but in my opinion could have done with a bit more humour.",0

Books_5,5,OR,"What an amazing way to end this series!

When we first where introduced to Asa, I was not impressed, he was the con man, a bad brother and up to no good. It was in Rome's book that he really started coming around and I really started to like him. I wanted him to turn things around, and he was trying really hard to be a better person. In this book, I just totally feel for him and my heart was at times breaking for him. He was trying so hard, but also so resigned to the fact that he was not a good person, that he was going to screw up and disappoint the people in his life. I loved Royal, she was strong and fierce, she was struggling with some of the same issues as Asa in the beginning, but otherwise, she was a woman that knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go after it, would not comprise who she was and her morals for anyone. She was strong and yet vulnerable. I really loved them together and their potential to be together.

Jay did a beautiful job wrapping this series up and giving everyone their happily ever after. I have loved every book, every Marked Man, every woman that has been their match. This has been an amazing series and I have enjoyed being on this wild ride with these guys. I am sad that it is over, but also can't wait to see what she has in store for us next!",0
Books_5,5,OR,"Dead Wake by Erik Larson is an engaging account of the sinking of the Lusitania. Using both primary and secondary sources, Larson tells the story from all sides. Once finished, the reader better understands not only what happened on board, but inside the U-boat that sunk her, as well as the broader historical context.

This is the first book of Larson's that I've read, and it officially made me a fan. His narrative style is smooth and entertaining. He was able to tell the story of a huge event using the little moments that better help us connect to history. Another great feature of this book was getting to understand what was happening not just on board the Lusitania, but also on U-20, the U-boat that sank her. Learning about that particular tour reinforces one of the themes of this account - that a million little things happened that led to the sinking. If just one of these many things had changed, on either side, the Lusitania would simply be the name of another ship from a bygone era.

Anyone interested in history, WWI, maritime history, U-boat history, or the politics of war will enjoy this book. It is extremely well written and just as important, accessible to the average reader.

Books_5,5,OR,"Wicked for You is another delicious Wicked Lovers novel by Shayla Black. Mystery Mullins, daughter of a famous Hollywood actor/director and Axel Dillon, her hero rescuer, are the focus of this book 10 in the Wicked Lovers series. The characters were well developed and grew along with the story. There were a couple surprises along the way that I wasn't expecting, which were great!

Axel is a large and extremely sexy man/Dom. His attitude toward what he is, is very serious. I was surprised to see that even he has insecurities. As serious as he is about being a Dom, his feelings for Mystery are so deep that he finds it a constant struggle to keep a scene going instead of just making love to her. What ever they're doing, it's done with plenty of steam rolling off the pages! Mystery strikes me as not having a great deal of common sense. Not exactly an airhead but close. Of course, that could be from being raised as a teenager with all the Hollywood glitz and glamour. As an adult, she's more grounded in the real world. Heath is the one I really feel bad for. Unrequited love is a horrible thing to have to deal with. Maybe we'll see him with his own story in the future.  The story had a natural flow along with some backstory to make you understand why things were happening the way they were. This was another great read from an author who NEVER disappoints!

Books_5,5,OR,"I have been provided a treat for the next twenty-eight days: one chapter of Camille Paglia's GLITTERING IMAGES per day, no more, no less. Today I read Chapter 1, on Queen Nefertari. It all began last night with a first reading of Paglia's bracing ""Introduction"" to her most recent book. The ""Introduction"" is required reading for anyone teaching undergraduates, but also for pre-tertiary level teachers. In it, Paglia deftly and clearly diagnoses the current condition of American culture and education, and prescribes the pharmakon: art. As always in her books, Paglia personalizes her perspective, which since SEXUAL PERSONAE has been among the few sources of fresh air in our ""confused"" times. She reminds us by example that there are still teachers in academe. They (we) are very much alive, often in small schools and universities without big names. Thanks to Pantheon for making her book available in its glittering form. If we pay attention to Paglia, there may be some chance of salvaging the sinking ship of undergraduate education. I would recommend that readers buy an extra copy of GLITTERING IMAGES and give it to a college or university administrator. If we take Paglia's advice, students might again be afforded an education and not job training. Here is the real thing. While the group of us who came of age intellectually during the 60's are aging, Paglia's latest is a reminder that we are far from finished. The operative word in Paglia's book is ""floating"" (sometimes ""hovering"" echoes it). It reminds us of what art provides: concrete transcendence.",0

It's so bad it's funny. Or it would be funny if people didn't actually listen to and believe this man.

And he is never after the truth, because the truth is a gray area and he only sees in black and white. Because he grew up rich and went to a boys' private Catholic school, he likes to think of himself as some kind of supreme arbiter over everyone.

The first few pages are the most relatable as we meet our protagonist (if he can be called that) as he realizes he can't find his cell phone. While not everyone uses their cell phone for pretty much everything, most people could even relate to the way he feels by thinking about a time when you can't find the remote control for the television and spend 20 minutes looking for it rather than changing channels manually. Technology appears, and before you know it we don't know what we would do without it. This sets up the theme for the book as Charlie loses his leg in an accident at work. Being unhappy with the prostheses available to him he proceeds to build his own. Thus begins a journey to constantly Better himself, and though his designs are for his own use, his company quickly sees their marketability, not just for people who have lost their limbs, but for people who want better parts than they were born with. What follows is a tale of technology that progresses faster than we can really learn to deal with it, with disastrous consequences for all involved. The book is infused with a dry humor and insightful philosophy about our relationship to technology and only really lost my attention in the last third when it became more of an action movie.

The entire book is a contrast and comparison between her ""younger"" mind and her ""older mind.

Moriarty takes a fascinating concept and infuses it with beautiful writing, relatable characters and a powerful story line. WHAT ALICE FORGOT also examines the amount of change that can happen to a person in a 10 year period and how these changes make us more interesting and complex individuals but can also create issues that we wish we could undo.

Books_5,4,OR,"Review courtesy of All Things Urban Fantasy. As charming and quirky as Gail Carrigers Soulless series, CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES delves back into all the ways that society, science, and magic can collide. Sophronias perspective on manners and intelligence gathering is a fantastic window into this world, which is as interesting for the social dynamics as for the dirigibles and mechanimals. From the outside, placing a spy training facility inside a Victorian finishing school would seem like an odd juxtaposition, but even new readers will quickly orient themselves to this mix of familiar historical setting and completely original world building. Sophronoia reads as a genuine teenager (though historical gloss makes her seem older than her 14 years), and her youth is a key element of what makes her compelling as a heroine. The choices that face her are relatable, from budding love to jealous rivals, and each one of these challenges foreshadows larger life issues she will face one day. As a lady intelligencer, Sophronia is learning how to blend with society, but will she also internalize the limitations and boundaries of the peers around her? Will she submerse herself in the cold, calculated, ignore-the-collateral-damage world of intelligence gathering? Or will she find a new path for herself, both professional and empathetic?

While the intricacies of the mystery in CURTSIES & CONSPIRACIES kept me glued to the page, it will be that larger question of Sophronias fate that will keep me coming back for more. Witty, charming, and brimming with potential, I cant wait to see the woman Sophronia is growing into.",0
Books_5,2,OR,"I really hated Annabel's family with all my tiny heart and soul. And I did not understand why Annabel just didn't go work in the fields by herself and leave her family to their own devices. That was really odd and kind of annoying.

Other than that, this book was decent enough. It's not the worst one I've ever read. I think there could have been a lot less bashing-you-over-the-head-with-religion, as in, it could have been much more subtly (and thus skillfully) done.

Stephen's character could have been fleshed out a lot more. He was kind of just in the background for most of the time, and so the part that focused on him didn't have as much impact as it could have. I like le Wyse and I liked Annabel, but their relationship was a little ""eh."" I loved Eustacia but thought she talked like Yoda. Most of the language in this book was a little weirdly done. I get that the author was trying to evoke the 1300s, but she didn't pull it off unfortunately. It just came off weird and it was very distracting to read the characters talk like normal people and then say ""Nay."" It reminded me of that John Pinette sketch ""I say nay nay!""

I thought the storyline with the baliff was well done, though I could have lived without Gilbert and Adam's characters. Same with Beatrice - did that actually have a point or not really?

And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.

This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.

A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them.
Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.

The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.

I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love reading about the lives of the young women who were on the train with a group of young men.  I wanted to know how the train crew would react when they saw the girls' faces.  I loved it and am glad I read it.  I read it every other week.

Books_5,5,OR,"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:
- Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa. So first off is the wait for the next book, whenever it will be. The second con is, if you fridge Sig because John's being too happy, then I'm taking all of this back, Mr. James.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"In the 21st book (of 32) of the Miss Silver series, the author not only uses her customary settings and characters (small village, lots of people with a keen interest in gossip, a pair of young lovers whose path isn't clear) but reruns some plot devices from previous novels in the series: someone returning after a long absence who was feared dead, someone asking for Miss Silver's assistance and failing to take her excellent advice, blackmail, an invalid who has nothing wrong but a desire to be catered to. This was written very competently in 1951 when the author was about 73 and had dozens of novels to her credit, so it's an engaging and assured read. I'm not giving it 5 stars only because of the retread plot devices. It's still interesting, and the young hero, Edward, is rather more romantically mysterious than her usual sort. Another aspect that is repeated (in a different manner) from the preceding novel is that Miss Silver, an elderly retired governess, is placed in danger. The earlier books kept danger mostly off-stage, with muted details reported at second or third hand. As the series progresses, though explicit violence is toned down, more action is permitted to be seen by the reader. As is often the case, the author makes the victims deserving of their fate and does not offer any positive sides to the bad guys. This is a weakness of hers, but it is in keeping with the Victorian morals of Miss Silver, a private enquiry agent who is the epitome of moral rectitude.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"The why gives you charisma; the why gives you strength, purpose, and direction; the why separates you from the flock. This idea is undeniably powerful and deserves widespread attention.

Sinek gets to the heart of success by showing the importance of having a higher purpose, or why, behind everything you do. The 200+ pages of the book are elaborations on this single idea. Some might find that length repetitive or overdone, and at times it is; but overall, I found the length helpful in exploring the power and ramifications of the idea.

Considering the fundamental why helps any organization discover its authentic identity, make all decisions on the basis of that authenticity, and project an authentic image to the public. When you have a solid, authentic core, Sinek suggests, decisions are easier and buyers are more attracted to you because you have conviction and you're serving the world for a greater purpose other than merely selling widgets like everyone else.

Starting with why doesn't apply only to business. It applies everywhere, to every project you're working on. It applies to your identity and your life's work. If you think about it, even the greatest artists are those who have had compelling ""why""s.

Alternate titles for the book could be ""The Way of Why"" or, after Eckhart Tolle, ""The Power of Why."" Start with Why is a quick read, yet powerful enough to change your outlook on marketing and persuasion, powerful enough to help you become a more focused and productive person and to help you live a more meaningful life.

I'm a religious person, and can appreciate the role of faith and positive thinking, but I didn't appreciate the tone of the book, that felt more like it was trying to brainwash me, than teach me.  I don't particularly mean brainwash in a bad way, but look at the techniques the book uses: It starts by talking up at great length how great it's main idea is going to be, repeats its positive goals over and over, tells you to control your thinking, and then to disassociate yourself from anyone or anything that thinks differently.  Don't get me wrong, that I think that positive thinking is powerful, and that the message of the book is a good one.

In Paradise, John tries to start a life as he acquaints himself with Sarah Hart, a friendly, smart ex-cheerleader. Of course, with an ex-cheerleader there's an ex-boyfriend, Mark James, who isn't so happy about the chemistry between John and Sarah. As John begins to fall for Sara, she becomes another person who would be in danger from the Mogadorians, another alien race that are hunting the Lorien teens.

Each Lorien teen is at a different place on Earth. Three have already been caught and killed, which is made clear through the scars on each of the remaining teens' ankles. As another one dies, another scar will appear in order to determine who will be hunted next. Because of a charm, the nine teens must be killed in their chronological order. As number four, John knows he's next.

Despite its controversial co-author, one can't argue that I AM NUMBER FOUR reads just like a script, so it's no surprise that it has been turned into a movie. The novel itself has scenes that are so action-packed, with a little romance thrown in, that it will captivate readers of all ages.

Books_5,4,OR,"Reviewing a book considered a classic is always an interesting task. It made it into the literary canon, so who am I to judge it? Therefore, my review mostly concerns how much the book personally appealed to me.

I have to admit I enjoyed this novel a lot more than I thought I would. It has been sitting on my shelf for years. Furthermore, this is the first work I've read by Graham Greene. Through this first experience, I found his writing to be lyrical, haunting, and superbly styled.

The book is written in first person narrative, the majority of it from the perspective of Maurice Bendrix, a struggling author and not always an agreeable man. It details his love affair with married Sarah Miles set against the backdrop of Europe during World War II. Graham's depictions of the war at times feature so prominently that the setting seems a character all on its own. The events of the war are sometimes juxtaposed beside the events of the lovers' affair, such that one becomes a symbol for the other. For me, this was one of the most interesting things about the novel. When the narrative did switch to the perspective of Sarah, it was interesting to see how differently the two individuals experienced the same events.

Much of the book surrounds philosophical religious discussions, and at times, admittedly - these weren't all that riveting for me. From what I understand, however, religion, and Catholicism in particular were central to Graham's life and works, and so it figures that they would also play a prominent role in this novel.",0

Hislop that I came to this book immediately after Michael Chabon's Telegraph Avenue - now there's someone whose characters zing off the page, from whose pen flows effortlessly great prose and who can put together a damned good story. None of  which, sadly, applies to Ms Hislop. OK, so I might have been dazzled by Telegraph Avenue, but I think that even if I'd read The Thread close on the heels of say, a thoroughgoing perusal of the phone book, the latter would shine by comparison. I think that Ms Hislop intended The Thread to be a peon to Thessaloniki which is, I'll grant her, a great little city. But it never comes to life; if there is such a thing a taxidermic prose, Ms Hislop can do it. Poor old Thessaloniki is just a one-dimensional sketch under her hand, a stage set about which she poses a cast of cliched cardboard cutouts (the Nazi's mouth is 'thin' - aren't they always? - the protagonist's bad husband is fat and smelly; the university students are all intellectual firebrands.

Books_5,5,OR,"Given that fifteen of the sixteen previous customer reviews have contained cogent and quite articulate praise for Professor Fussell's book, my praises may seem redundant.  However, this is such a brilliant and important book that I am compelled to write about it.
  I have been obsessed with The GW&MM since I first read it in 1978, so obsessed that I have read it many times.  Each time I read it new ideas and new authors spring out of the text and send me to the library or bookstore.  Fussell's prose is captivating, and his scholarship is breathtaking in both breadth and depth.  My first reading of The GS&MM was in Belgium during a Sabbatical year in Brussels.  Our son was writing a senior ISP on the effect of the German invasion on Belgium, and we went to Ypres as part of the research.  We were both overwhelmed by the 105 Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries there, and reading The GW&MM during that period helped to put these beautiful and touching burial grounds into the context of the mud and stink that was the Salient during (and for several years after) 1914-1918.
  Prof. Fussell introduced me to Graves (my favorite) and Sassoon and Blunden and David Jones and Wifred Owen and opened the door to these wonderful novelists and poets for a biochemist without much appreciation of British literature.

Books_5,5,OR,"""The Winter's Tale"" is one of Shakespeare's last plays, and it boasts one of the best ensembles of characters in the entire canon. This is a text where no single character dominates, and many have more than one brilliant moment.
The play follows the jealously inspired downfall, and eventually redemption, of King Leontes. While taking us on that journey Shakespeare glorifies the ideas of grace and forgiveness, the simplicity of country life, the lasting bonds of friendship, the power of parenting, the ardor of young love, the patience of mature love, and in the great character of Paulina, the lengths and benefits of loyalty. This text is the result of a writer at the top of his game, and the episodic plot (it takes place over 16 years) allows the Bard to weave in many varying themes that lead to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion.
This text is often maligned as not one of Shakespeare's better efforts, and I wholeheartedly disagree. Read it, and then try to find a really superior theatre company doing a performance. Enter the kingdoms of Sicilia and Bohemia; meet Paulina, Autolycus, the Old Shepherd and his doltish son, as well as many others. You will be glad you did!
As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period.

Books_5,5,OR,"Mary Shelley, who, in my assumption, was truly a fascinating author. She weaved together a very fast moving extraordinary saga, THE LAST MAN that kept me enthralled. Lionels life began on a cheerful note, but then tragedy struck. As I watched Lionels emotions go from sorrow, to bliss, back to sorrow, then grief in one brief moment took him by the throat and would not let go until his heart was broken. As deep depression set in he felt pure torment and could do nothing but try to comfort those around him as his dear friends, neighbors, and family departed, one by one, from what seemed to be a never-ending epidemic that swept through each countryside. This skillfully written masterpiece of a seriously tragic and also an intensely passionate story regarding love found, then lost through devastation, which led to unspeakable sorrow and loneliness, held me as I read line after line, and page after page, savoring every word. As I followed Lionel through his existence, in each chapter he must take action against this foe that always seemed to have the upper hand in everything, and yet, each time, he knew he must move on because of the need to find others. Will he have to live in constant silence, or will there be someone out there waiting to be heard?

The storyline was original, that's for sure.  And his emotion is raw.  He definitely has his finger on the pulse of something - although what exactly that is (misdirected youth?  the refusal to accept that people usually _earn_ money?) is sometimes muddled.
But the delivery is poor.  I found it cutesy and contrived.  He relies on the same old gag structure again and again - that one line delivered at the very end to set the last three pages' worth of diatribe on its ear:  ""You just missed your exit"".  ""The wallet was there the whole time.""  and so on.  Add that to the fact that the timeline was impossible to follow, and that the technique of alternating paragraphs between two different time periods does not a gifted writer make, and this presentation had serious flaws.
Unrestrained by literary devices such as plot, he goes on to present a convoluted ""three years [I think it was three years although time flow was truly warped] in the life of"" stream-or-consciousness (whoops I meant ""stream OF consciousness"") story of his recent life.

I saw even then, at a young age, how possible it was for this world to become a reality. How many people try to lose themselves in drugs, alcohol, meaningless TV? We are closer to this Brave New World than we like to admit. Can this insanity our world is headed toward be stopped? I don't know but I fear that Huxley understood the human conditon all too well. We believe everything we hear on TV or read in the newspapers. Too many of us have left our intelligence and perception at the door. Wake up before it is too late and think for yourself. There was a version of Brave New World with Leonard Nimoy which presented a sort of happy ending for two people, which did not occur in the book but still leaves the Brave New World untouched. I won't say too much about John ""the Savage"" who was more human than the rest of the population but he is the mirror Huxley uses to show us how barren and sterile this Brave New World is.

While I read it very quickly and enjoyed Stephanie Perkins ability to tell a good story, I just didn't love this one as much as everyone else did. Before you get confused by my 4-star rating, I'll start off with what I liked about it: the writing was well done, the pacing was good, the characters felt very natural, and it was very romantic at times (in a genuine, loving way -- not a sexual way). I read most of this book in about a day, and didn't feel like it was dragging at any point in the story. Moving on to the factors that deducted from the star rating. I just did not like Isla and Josh together. I felt that their relationship was not a healthy one and that they really didn't bring out the best in each other.

I read this book in the fall of 1999, when I was a student in college. I was a little skeptical of the value of this book. I was interested in the possibilities of the book, but I was also concerned that it would be marketed as a book for the general public. I was quite surprised to see that the author had written a book with a title like ""The Secrets of Your Life"" which is the subtitle. I felt that it was a little too general in a way that it was not.

Books_5,5,OR,"""Ordinary Men"" chronicles the rise and fall of Reserve Police Battalion 101, one of several units that took part in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question while in Poland. During the course of their stay, they were responsible for the shooting of 38,000 Jews, while also deporting 45,200 to the Treblinka Concentration Camp. The book argues that the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, and other units like it, were comprised of ordinary men. It begs the question: How did ordinary men become the cold-blooded killers of the Holocaust?

Author Christopher R. Browning does a tremendous job of covering the ground. He also presents a strong case that these people were indeed ordinary men, who came from ordinary backgrounds, only to end up being transformed into the murderers of thousands. However, the book also stresses that some of the men, including several officers, could not be considered ""ordinary,"" as they were trained in Hitler's Nazi organizations from youth. Browning also does something nearly impossible: He humanizes these people without excusing their horrendous actions. Their defense that ""they were just following orders"" just doesn't fit the bill, as some refused to take part in the actions, and asked to be relieved. If a few men could get themselves relieved from doing the killings, why did so many more not? That is the main question the book gives. ""Ordinary Men"" is an extraordinary book that chronicles just one unit that took part in the murder of innocent Jews, while also presenting a good case of how ordinary men can become killers. I highly recommend this book to all students of the Holocaust.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Michael Crichton continues to explore the front edge of speculative fiction in Next, which reads like slices of life turned upside down by the availability of genetic engineering. Crichton explores many facets in parallel stories, bringing in a cast of dozens of characters--many of whom aren't burdened with ethical compass or morals to object to the growing invasiveness of advances, disregarding the physical dangers, and setting perilous precedents that could impact all life on the planet.

Next reads as a morality tale, where virtually every turn is for the worse. Vignettes interplay and rush toward a climax that puts characters on the same page, even if they seem to be thrown together for the convenience of tying loose plot lines. But the real story is a plot of themes. What are the consequences of manipulating complex systems of which man has the slightest knowledge? Just because it's possible, do we have the right to play God in the creative process? Can we foretell the results in emergent research that identifies a single variable in a chain of processes that interact in ways we've barely begun to comprehend? Crichton lays out a case for caution, without turning the book into a pulpit.

The stories in Next were compelling examples looking into the abuses of science. Although stories of talking animals (an African Gray parrot, a foul-mouthed multi-lingual orangutan, and a humanpanzee adopted into family life) were reminders that we're reading fiction, even if several of the story lines borrow from actual cases of genetic precedent. Next shows a causality of legal challenges and life implications of ignoring the dangers of unbridled creative power.",0

Quite a few of the ""fictitious"" presentations in this book sported titles (and contents) that were uncomfortably familiar. (What can I say? I was young...I didn't know any better...)  As for the back-biting, infighting, petty scheming, feuds, and general unmitigated nastiness--it's all too true. Fortunately, in Lodge's hands, it's also funny enough to take the sting out of some of the more pointed barbs.

And, if Lodge's lampoon of academia isn't enough to tickle your funny bone, you'll surely get a laugh out of the misguided kidnapping, adultery, unrequited love, requited love, strippers, porn, a journey around the world, and one of the most hilarious scenes in print (a karaoke bar in Tokyo that was definitely lost in translation).

Lodge's writing is a pleasure to read. He is clever (without being precious), ironic, poignant, even lyrical in places. As befitting a novel about literary criticism, there are references to everyone we know and love: Shakespeare (All's Well That Ends Well), Oscar Wilde (The Importance of Being Ernest--the twins are found in a Gladstone bag), and, naturally, the Grail Quest with all of its incumbent post-modernist/feminist permutations. I was thoroughly delighted to see that Lodge even referenced himself. (On page 280 Angelica's father bemoans the ignorance about identical twins. He mentions that he ""didn't have the patience"" to read a novel which featured identical twins of opposite sexes. The novel was David Lodge's ""Changing Places."")

The Thief of Always is also a great choice for anyone smitten by Lemony Snicket, as it features a similarly dark story line with menacing adult characters.

I felt like Duane spent too much time making inside jokes, displaying ""cute"" aspects of wizardry (I don't think I can forgive her for ""WizPod,"" still), and name-dropping about a bajillion previous characters so we wouldn't forget about them before they became completely unimportant to the plot. I did like where it led, though--to the terrifying transformation of Nita's partner Kit into a tool of his previous Martian incarnation, and I liked how Nita didn't lose her cool when she was scared and had to rescue Kit.

Despite being about aliens, I saw a disappointing side of ""human"" nature reflected in the two transplanted Martian cultures refusing to give up their desire to fight each other--it was what they lived for and what they died for. Nita and Kit finally acknowledging some of their attraction was nice, though I would have been just as happy to see a special partnership that was close and nearly sacred WITHOUT being romance. And I thought it was odd that Duane spent so much time focusing on stuff Dairine was doing without actually mixing it into the plot's finale.

Books_5,3,OR,"I was interested in this book because of the uncommon setting of St. Louis--a city I love, but one that is definitely falling apart. That decay is beautifully described by Franzen. There's no doubt that the prose in 'The Twenty-Seventh City' nearly always sparkles and only occasionally falls flat, usually when he gets too caught up in his philosophical meanderings inside the head of Martin Probst (who is quietly and slowly lovable). There are so many artful descriptions and astute retellings of every-day occurrences to propel readers. Unfortunately, the interesting premise never expands much beyond its setup in the first 50 pages. S. Jammu and her comrades are interesting, but haughty, and their reasons for taking on their twisted plot are never clarified beyond vague sketches of their activist and corrupted pasts. EVERYone in high society, apparently, enters into either physical or intellectual affairs, which often defy their characterisations, and there are so many characters that are highlighted in their dull everyday routines just to service their importance in the book's ending that it drags down the beginning in middle. And when the climax of a 500-page novel hinges on the outcome of a referendum vote... well, I think that's all that needs to be said about that.
Still, Franzen's observations on our every day lives and interactions are shocking in their familiarity, and he undeniably has a good grip on many facets of how our society and culture functions. Twenty years after the fact his comments are still relevant. 'The Twenty-Seventh City' is worth reading, but only if read quickly; labouring over it and its blunted intricacies is not worth the time.",0

Books_5,5,OR,"This series of books by ""Lemony Snicket"" does not have the standard ""happy ending"" of most children's books. The 3 kids in the stories (newly orphaned) have miserable lives with one thing going wrong after another. To make matters worse, their ""uncle"" - bad guy Count Olaf - wants their money and is always after them.  He and his evil minions are forever plaguing the lives of the Baudelaire children and cause constant mayhem.

Because of all this misery, I thought my 8-year-old son wouldn't like them - wrong! He absolutely loves them and is always begging me to read one more chapter! The writing is dry, but funny with loads of humor (much is directed to adults). The books contain many ""large"" or unusual words/expressions, but almost all are explained in the text (which can get annoying). I would say these books are good for kids from 7 - 14 (although use your judgement for the younger ones as the books do have evil bad guys, murder and lots of threats). As an adult reading the books to your kids, you might get a little frustrated as the stories are similar and the adults in the books are really dense - but these are for kids and they seem to love them!

The story is definitely moving along toward conclusion and we should have all the answers by book 13 (very appropriate!).  Readers will enjoy the series more if they are able to read the books in order as they build on each other - so this collection will be perfect for those new to the series - and the price is super.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"It was a long time coming, this book, ""One Was a Soldier."" It downloaded to my Kindle and I dug in happily. I had to pace myself, as my inclination was to inhale it in one sitting. The story itself is something of a departure from the standard mystery format. The serious issues facing veterans returning from war take center stage for at least the first third of the book, and, after the actual mystery kicks in, Spencer-Fleming continues to pull this thread through to the end. The relationships among the characters that began in earlier novels in the series are brought forward and developed further. What I enjoy most about Spencer-Fleming's writing is the little touches, and the way her characters remain true to themselves. In this story, Clare is struggling with issues surrounding re-entry into her life as pastor in Miller's Kill. Some of the effects of the war in which she has just been engaged have changed her and altered her reality. She has the same issues as other soldiers who return from combat. But Clare is a priest, and donning her collar, along with all its attendant expectations, makes dealing with those issues that much more difficult. In her construction of the dialogue, the author makes Clare's very human struggle apparent and sympathetic.

Other writers here have reviewed the story in greater detail. A lot happens in ""One Was a Soldier."" There is significant progress in the story for all the characters, but there is plenty left on the bone for the future. I await the next installment in the series excitedly. Spencer-Fleming is a fine writer. Her novels never disappoint.",0

You could not make up a character like Yoshi.  His personality is truly unique and could only exist in real life.  A fictional person such as he would be laughed off the page.
This book is so rich, filled with so many fascinating elements, and from the very beginning, the reader knows he will not be able to put it down.  Jessica Speart is an unusual combination of nature enthusiast  expert and mystery writer, which makes the varying elements of her story hang together so well.

Included  is a description of his case against pigeon breeders that is totally apart from the central narrative and could support an entire book on its own.  This is also an entire treatise on the nature of obsession and the need to own the rare, the exotic, the item on the verge of extinction.

Delirium was a delightful read! I had just finished reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and so Delirium was a great book to read while I was in that ""Dystopian"" book phase (which I still am).
Delirium is set in a Dystopian future where their society believes that love is a disease that people can be cured of at the age of 18. Lena has just a little over three months before she turns 18, but she falls in love. She meets a boy named Alex who woos her, they fall in love, and then it kind of has a twist at the end... one that makes you go... ""Wait! WHAT!?! WHY!?""

What I liked
I really liked Lauren Oliver's style of writing. The plot never seemed choppy, it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter which is always a plus. The plot is kind of original and I say ""kind of"" because it is a Dystopian novel and these kinds of novels always have something outlawed, or forbidden. The forbidden thing in this novel would be the feeling of love. This means that you are matched with some one who you don't love, and you will never love. They will be your roommate who sleeps in the same bed with you. When you have kids you will only be watching and taking care of them out of duty, not out of love.

What I didn't like
Nothing. I really, really liked this book.

I happen to like learning what a day may have looked like at sea in that era but not to the extent that it is all that we learn about over all the pages except the last thirty when the action begins but is broken with an abrupt ending. Of course the action resumes where it left off at the beginning of the next book. In what is rapidly becoming a dissatisfying series, this is the supreme example of dissatisfaction up to this point in my opinion. As usual, I cant fault the writing but the point of this story seems to have been to sell one more book no matter the consequences of not providing an entertaining story. When I first read this series I thought every one of them was a masterpiece of naval historical work. Now that Ive been hooked by the genre, I can say many more recent writers have exceeded these last few books in story telling quality. Two that immediately come to mind are Dewey Lambdin and Jay Worrell. From the same timeframe when OBrian was writing, I value Dudley Popes work more highly.

Books_5,5,OR,"Romantic suspense is at its very best with this latest read from Ms. Wainscott. Wrapped up in one terrific package is a rampant serial killer, a controlling husband, a beaten-down wife, and a handsome mysterious loner all connected in this intricate and suspenseful plot.
With the reappearance of ""Spooky Silas"" Koole, Katie is reminded of the girl she used to be before she married local vet and her savior, Ben Ferguson. After her mother died, Katie lived with another family and was befriended by Ben who had aided her when Gary, the bully, injured her kitten. Now, after nine years of marriage, Katie is but a shell of her former self, complacent and pleasing, no longer the spirited girl Silas remembered.
Even as Silas warns Katie to trust no one, the serial killer strikes again, leaving no body, and Silas is the main suspect. And fear strikes Katie, as the list of possible suspects cleverly emerges: Is it Gary, the kitten abuser and gruff cop, Harold, the creepy ""art"" dealer, Silas, who empathetically feels the killer, or Ben, the town hero and control freak husband?
As love emerges between loner Silas and a damaged Katie, it becomes so much more than just romance, mainly a culmination of life-long love deepening into mature adult love. As they begin to trust one another, Katie is forced to question her marriage, her mother's death years before, and her life, as she has known it for the last nine years.

Books_5,2,OR,"I think like many book series, you can't start mid-series. I read many glowing reviews of this book and most of them mention the previous books. Coming into this fresh (I'd not heard of Joe R. Lansdale), the characters and the plot seemed very thin, although the earlier books probably established these elements. When I first started the book, it seemed like a strange amalgam of political correctness, graphic violence, and Fletch-like irreverence. As the story progresses, however, dreadful scene piles on dreadful scene until the book comes across as truly sadistic.

There is an ugly American (Billy) who seeks to humiliate a Mexican girl in the most unpleasant and crude matter. The reader endures many pages of this behavior. I suppose these scenes are intended to justify Hap and Leonard brutally assaulting this guy again and again and again. Finally, Hap literally spreads his own feces on Billy's face, beats him, and makes him stand in the corner. And then does it again. This comes in a scene right after our ""heroes"" discover a girl that's been dismembered with a machete. The reader is treated to an explanation of where the individual pieces of the girl are located about the hotel room. The graphic violence continues up until the final chapter of the novel.

Oh, did I mention that the book opens with a brutal beating of another girl whom Hap saves?  Unfortunately for the girl, Hap doesn't save her until after she's been repeatedly raped, had her face ""stomped in,"" her nipple bitten off, jaw crushed, teeth knocked out, and lost an eye.

Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World.

Books_5,4,OR,"I am a big fan of books on the history of science and technology. This book is a valuable addition to my collection.

In this book, the author makes a good argument for the screwdriver being the most important tool invented in the last thousand years. It seems like such a simple invention, yet he demonstrates via good research the importance and discovery of the screwdriver. He makes a less-well researched claim to the history of the screw.

Many tools that we commonly use are much more ancient than the last millennium-the hammer, axe, plane, and so forth are ancient tools, well developed in Roman times. Yet the screw and screwdriver, essential today, are fairly new, developed during the late middle ages or early renaissance periods.

One of the best parts of the book is chapter 5, where not only reveals the 'first' screwdriver, but information on Henry Maudslay, Jesse Ramsden. Joseph Whitworth, Joseph Clement, Richard Roberts, and James Nasmyth, most of whom I had never heard of before. Maudslay and this small group of mechanical geniuses were the people who 'invented precision' as another writer put it. In other words, this group devised the machine tools required for precision work. They are mentioned in this book because a lot of their work revolved precision screws, their use and manufacture.

That's one of the things that I like about this kind of history. One good book can lead to an area of discovery and knowledge that the reader might not know about. Since reading this book, I have become interested in the history of machine tools and their inventors.

A good book, well written. Recommended.

Books_5,5,OR,"Majorie Kinnan Rawlings had a great deal of talent, and did a *lot* of research for this book that takes place in 1871-1872.  She also was blessed with the most brilliant of editors, Max Perkins, who was an editor for 20th century literary giants like Fitzgerald and Hemingway.

It was Perkins who kept Rawlings on track with her novel, reminding her that the novel should not be just written 'for a boy' but also 'about a boy'.  He was the one who pointed out to her that her writing genius lay in stringing together episodes rather than hatching out intricate plots.  In addition, it was Perkins who reminded Rawlings that the setting was full of tough times and tough people & she should avoid the theatricality and romanticism that sometimes crept into early drafts of the novel and really strive to emphasize, even increase the naturalism.

 Finally, Perkins remained dissatisfied with Rawlings' early title: The Fawn.  He suggested that she find a more symbolic title.  When she came up with titles like The Flutter-Mill or Juniper Island, he held her to her task, saying that there was not enough human suggestion.  When she sent him a list including the eventual title, Perkins was satisfied that this was the right one.

Shortly after that, Rawlings decided what she'd written was inferior & threw it out.  Perkins prodded her to get going again.  This book IS a classic, Rawlings WAS talented, unbelievably so, but neither would be as true if it were not for the dedicated brilliance of Max Perkins.

Books_5,5,OR,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!",0
Books_5,3,OR,"This book's biggest accomplishment is reminding one what a great work of art Nabakov's masterpiece is.

My main problem with Tampa was that the main character did come across as a believable human being.  Whereas Humbert Humbert for all his deviant predilections was often a relateable  character, Celeste, the sexual-predator narrator and overwhelmingly dominant figure of Tampa, struck me as a one note, sex-addled sociopath; all the other characters in the book are too peripheral to engage much of the reader's attention.

Tampa is filled with detailed and uninteresting sex scenes.  The main interest is wondering how Celete's downfall will be brought about.  I hoped Celeste's ensuing public disgrace and trial to turn to a Bonfire of the Vanities type spectacle but that section of the book apparently occupied little of the author's attention because it sped by perfunctorily.

I was drawn to Tampa initially by enthusiastic reviews in credible sources such as Slate.  I wonder if much of this enthusiasm was the result of the phenomenon of male critics being automatically wowed and over impressed when female artists frankly address female sexuality (cf. Liz Phair).  Lisa Zeidner's review in the Washington Post (available online as of this writing) seemed a more accurate assessment of Tampa.

One may wonder why I gave Tampa even three stars.  First of all, I'm a generous grader when it comes to books.  Second of all, it did contains several humorous passages and passages of well wrought writing.  Third of all, despite its flaws, I'll remember it.  Lastly the author deserves some credit for daring the comparison to a canonical masterwork and inspiring one to reread its literary inspiration.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"Some serial characters don't hold up well after repeated exposure. They become a bit stale, too predictable, but Jack Reacher? Never! Lee Child is way too good at this game. He sets the hook then leaves little bits here and there, some obvious, some not so, but all keep the reader saying ""OK, just a few more pages,"" then a few more, and a few more. The narrative is first person Reacher, and strictly linear. There are subplots galore, but the straightforward style makes them easy to follow.
At the outset, Reacher enters the Pentagon with a target on his back. He's in uniform, an MP major, but scruffy, needs a haircut and a shave. He's posted to Kelam, a Ranger Base south of Tennessee where a young woman has been murdered, her throat slashed in military fashion. If this turns out to be a soldier killing, things will go very bad for the base and its in habitants. Reacher has an opposite number on the inside, Major Munro, also MP, but Reacher works, as always, on the outside.
He contacts the local sheriff, a stunning young woman who complicates his job by spotting him immediately. She's done similar work with the Marine Corps, but has made little progress solving the murder.
Reacher does his work in his own way, as usual, playing within the rules but just barely. I'll leave the rest of the plot description to the reader. No need to spoil someone else's fun.
In the end, as usual, Reacher leaves town, mission accomplished, a beautiful sheriff pining for him but knowing he's not a man who stays in one place for any longer than necessary.

Books_5,5,OR,"The cover art of headless viewers watching television says it all. My only brush with the late Neil Postman came when he spoke at the university I was attending in the northwest. A breezy east coaster, he was unaware of the need to step on eggs. During the questions, one woman said, ""Mr. Postman, how can we help children have self-esteem?"" to which he replied, ""I don't want them to have self-esteem; I want them to esteem something other than themselves.""

After the stunned silence I and a few others rose and started clapping; it was very much as if life had been returned to Pepperland in Yellow Submarine. I've been clapping inwardly ever since, as when I read this book.

There are hundreds of reviews of this book, which created a stir everywhere. Everyone (except the people running TV) seems to have read it. Most readers find it smooth going. However, those who don't want to tackle the book can still wrestle with the ideas. In Postman's essay collection, Conscientious Objections, he replies to the question ""Why are books so long?"" with the answer that they don't have to be, and as an example gives a short version of this book.

The basic thesis is that along with George Orwell's 1984 in which civilization lapses into a dystopia (opposite of a utopia) ruled by oppression and violence, there was the opposite vision in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that society would be destroyed by indulgence in pleasure. Postman says that while you can make a good case for the first view, the second is in full swing. Now if only the desperate networks would read this book and (re)turn to making good TV.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is the last of Coelho's trilogy that explores the parameters of Good and Evil and their impact on the human soul.  In this story a stranger, battered and disheartened by the absolute worse that life can dish out, visits a small town with the intentions of carrying out an experiment aimed at assuaging some of his bitterness and pain.  While in the village, he enlists the help of Miss Prym who, bored with small town living, sees an opportunity for escape; but at what cost?  As the story unfolds the people of Viscos learn of the experiment and how they, collectively and individually, can benefit from it.  It is Coelho's interrogation of the villagers' intentions that provides the reader with a glimpse of the dueling forces of good and evil.

The novel is very well translated as I never felt that something was missing while reading it.  The language is loaded with meaning and highly symbolic.  ""Viscos is just like any other village in the world and whatever happens there happens in every continent, city, camp, convent, wherever.""  This is the wisdom shared with Miss Prym by Berta, the village's aged sage who spends her days watching over the village in an effort to see any evil coming.  I've always enjoyed Coelho's work and ""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is no different.  This is a solid story that's easily read and internalized.  Ultimately, what we learn about good and evil from this text sounds a lot simpler than I expected and much more easily articulated than done.  This is a quick yet profound read.  Highly Recommended.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"Growing up, there are certain stories that you are told are classics.  Your parents have read them, your teachers suggest them and all the critics continually laud them.  `The Swiss Family Robinson' is one of those books.  Just the very title causes one to take notice, and if you have ever read the book or happened to see the Disney film, you are taken to a lovely place of nostalgia whenever someone mentions it.

The great thing about books like this one is that these stories and the way they are shaped, molded and ultimately told are timeless.  Any age, sex or domination can and will enjoy this.  There are so many themes broached, but in a beautiful package that never feels overwhelming or too stuffed.  Everything feels relaxed and natural.  It is also a testament to real storytelling that the novel remains exciting and intriguing no matter how familiar you are with the story.  Settling in this past month to read this to my kids was a great way to relive the beauty and grace of this novel, watching it captivate them as well as me (new ears and old).

The language is fluid (which is not always so in these older classics) and the action is always present, even during seeming mundane situations.  My children were always intrigued, and I loved plowing through the chapters with them.  The lush imagery presented by Wyss is unforgettable and really a notch above most of what we have to read today.

Books_5,4,OR,"I enjoyed this book.  The author has a strong voice, but the book was much less overtly personalized than the editorial reviews led me to expect, for which I was grateful. In all other respects, I thought the editorial reviews are pretty good summaries of what you will find in this book.

It could have been better edited.  Despite its chronological organization, there are a surprising number of places where a person or event who has died earlier in the book pops up again. For instance, after the chapter on  Mussolini is over, with Mussolini quite dead, one moves to a chapter that begins with the Allied invasion in WWII with Mussolini quite alive again.  Just some light editing would have smoothed this out very easily.  The index is, in the same vein, sparse and poor and omits references too often.

Last, the text emphasizes the visual aspect of Rome, as one would expect from an art critic.  But there are only two sets of photos, perhaps 30 or so altogether, a mere fraction of the images and sights described by the author.  I often wanted to be able to compare his descriptions to photographs of what he is describing but it is only rarely possible within the covers of the book. I don't know if the ebook is different but the experience of reading would really be enhanced if there were more photos located closely to what is being described or at least hyperlinks to an image on the web with what is being described.

Books_5,4,OR,"I'm very pleased with the 4th addition update of The C++ Programming Language.

Dr. Stroustrup takes the approach of presenting the current version of the language (C++ 11) as a whole, rather than attempting to show what's new in C++ 11 compared to C++ 03.  At approximately 1300 pages of text, it takes commitment to make it through the entirety of the content, but you'll most likely be a better programmer if you do.

If you've attempted to read previous versions and didn't like Stroustrup's approach, then you probably won't like the new edition either.  On the other hand, if you appreciated the 3rd edition, you will probably like the 4th edition as well.

He presents the language in a rather terse style of writing with very short and fairly contrived examples, so it's probably not the best book for beginners.  On the other hand, if you are already an intermediate to advanced C++ programmer, he explains a lot of the finer points very clearly.  Some of the topics he addresses are difficult to find documented elsewhere. For example the precise type of literals -- 3, ""foo"", 4.0, 5.1f;  internal vs external linkage; unnamed namespaces; etc. Since he invented the language and is a very active member of the standards committee, you can trust that the information is accurate.

One of the other things I like about this book is the fact that Stroustrup is wiling to editorialize just a bit and describe things that he considers to be ugly, embarrassing, or bad style.  He manages to do this without ranting, which is really nice.  He also gives advice about constructs to avoid and techniques to embrace.

Books_5,3,OR,"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.

Books_5,5,OR,"Review of:  ""What Paul Meant""

By: Garry Wills

Paul was the first letter writer of Christianity.

His epistles are considered the most pessimistic writings of the early church.

Despite the pessimism of Paul's epistles, he guided the early church and aided the growth of the early church.  The author, Garry Wills, calls the growth of the early church an explosion of belief.  He says of Paul:  ""Paul was part of this explosion of belief.""  Garry Wills says that Nietzsche called Paul the ""dysangelist"" or the bad news bearer, and ""a man with a genius for hatred.""  This is in contrast to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, the ""evangelists"" or the good news bearers.

The author asks the question: ""how much of this notoriety is deserved?""  His answer: ""very little.""

This book uses seven of Paul's letters: ""Letter to the Thessalonians"", ""Letter to the Galatians"", ""Letter to the Philippians"", ""Letter to Philemon"", ""First Letter to the Corinthians"", ""Second Letter to the Corinthians"" and ""Letter to the Romans.""  These are the letters whose authorship is not disputed.

Author Wills shows that Paul echoed and amplified the message of love spoken by Jesus.  Paul had the same message of love as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John when he reports on the teaching of Jesus.

This book also gives details of the life of Paul and of the history of early Christianity.

Books_5,5,CG,"In another review, I rated this book 3.5 out of 5.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the most powerful man in the world, the great ruler of the world, is in the process of ascending to the throne. This man is still waiting for the sun to set. And with it, he will rise and be the one to rule the world.

This book is about the life of a strong man, the one that can conquer the world, and his father, the great king, who will be the one to rule the world.

The book starts off with a good introduction to the subject matter, but as the book progresses, you begin to get to know the main characters. I loved how the author used a lot of descriptive and narrative language to bring the story to life.

At the beginning of the book, the main character, Eileen, is a woman who has a husband and two children. She is a single mom and is in love with her husband. She is always doing something to help her children. Eileen does everything she can to help them, and it seems that she is constantly being selfish. When her husband dies, she finds a beautiful young man who is going to help her out. The story is very well written, and the characters are likable.

I really enjoyed the book. The main character, Alan, is",1

Books_5,1,OR,"I didn't like this book and I didn't like Sally Mann.  It was the most boring book I have read in a long time.  First of all, she really puts a great emphases on how smart she supposedly is.  She includes notes from elementary, high school and college teachers.  Pardon me while I yawn.

  This book is interspersed with photos, copies of notes and letters, and anything Mann throws in to make herself look good.  Her notoriety comes from the nude photos she took of her children growing up.  Many people found them sexually suggestive.  I found them exploitive but not really offensive.  Mann spends time defending herself on the photos calling herself nave time and time again.  That's OK for awhile but it gets tiresome when she doesn't smarten up at all.  She is shocked that pedophiles are interested in them. Really?

  She also separates the pictures from the children.  She says the children are merely actors in the pictures and can keep the two separate identities apart even the 6 year old. Then she goes on to say how nice it is to have pictures of their childhood.  Which is it?  Are they separate or true depictions?

  After that she goes on to explore past relations.  She discusses her husband's parents murder/suicide.  Then she goes on to discuss kinfolk in even the more distant past.  This is when I lost complete interest and just thumbed through the rest of the book's pictures.  By then I was so turned off that I didn't even enjoy them.

Books_5,3,OR,"Ahh...such a pretty cover that contains a book that is really nothing special.  But, I've read the Vampire Kisses series by Schrieber, so I was kind of expecting it.

I actually liked Celeste and I liked Brandon.  Celeste is different than the typical teenager in her crowd.  It stands out right from the beginning.  She goes with the flow because it's the easy thing to do.  She didn't want to loose her friends by rocking the boat.  I wasn't surprised by it.  I also liked how Brandon is different.  He doesn't fit it with either crowd.  It's especially interesting when we learn about his life at his previous school.  I also like the chemistry between Celeste and Brandon, that is until it got a little over the top.  It's like an inevitable part of teen fiction sometimes.

I wasn't particularly found of Celeste's friends.  They seemed so shallow.  And Nash was just not likable at all.  I was expecting a love triangle type of things.  But, Nash was hard for me to swallow.  I also didn't really like the town divided thing.  It just didn't work with the story in my eyes.  The actual legend of the werewolf was different.  It was really tame compared to other stories.  But, then again it fits into the author's idea of vampires in her other series.

Books_5,4,OR,"In the previous installment of the Heroes of Olympus series, we learned that Percy Jackson, much like Jason in The Lost Hero, has lost his memory and is at a camp for demigods that he's never known of: Camp Jupiter. As with most of the books in both The Heroes of Olympus series and the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, we begin at the camp (though the Roman camp operates very differently from Camp Half-blood) before embarking upon a seemingly impossible quest. Rick Riordan never misses an ingredient in his books. Adventure? We've got that in spades as Percy and his new friends, Frank and Hazel take on monsters, Amazons, gorgons, and giants on their quest. Serious shtuff? Well let's see. Both Frank and Hazel have had issues with their families, Percy can't remember the rest of his life, and there's that itty-bitty little ""Gaia's trying to take over the world"" thing they've got to contend with. Romance? Got that too, just a bit. Annabeth is all that Percy really remembers and. well, I don't want to spoil you. Let's just say that's a pinch more crushiness (I'm making up words now, deal with it) than that. And humor? Um, hello? Percy's back and he's always been sarcastic and a little hilarious. Frank and Hazel aren't missing a sense of humor either. When the mood gets a little darker it doesn't last long, one of them will either crack a joke or Riordan will throw in a hilarious villain to break it without interrupting the flow of the story. Basically, The Son of Neptune did not disappoint. Overall Rating: 4. 5/5.

For some recreational reading, I picked up Dale Brown's Plan Of Attack.  This is one of those military war thrillers involving the use of hi-tech weaponry to defeat the enemy.  Overall, a pretty good read.
In the latest episode of Patrick McLanahan's adventures, he's been demoted a rank for once again skirting a direct order given to him for defending a certain area by having and using some offensive weapons when they are attacked.  He ends up tucked away at a desk top with strict orders to mind his own business and just do his job.  But he ends up getting intel that points to Russia preparations to launch a full-scale nuclear attack on the US.  His direct superiors won' t listen to what appears to be an outlandish conclusion, so he goes over their heads and ends up facing a court martial.  But of course, he's right and the attack takes place.  His small group of hi-tech commandos are one of the few resources left to counter-attack, and he has to once again disobey some orders in order to make his plan happen.
Since this book uses characters that have appeared in other Dale Brown novels, there is not a lot of background character development.  If you haven't read the previous novels, you might be a little lost as to why McLanahan is viewed in such a negative light.  The story moves along at a decent pace, and the different weaponry is interesting to think about.  While I didn't see it as a ""can't put it down"" book, I did enjoy the read.",0

Books_5,1,OR,"One finds out pretty clearly and directly who the murderer is about midway through the book.  At that point then, since there's a lot of book left, the plot must follow the police closing in on the killer and an exciting finish.  That requires attention to pacing with matters picking up and slowing down.  That's what made Da Vinci Code such a good read as well Le Carre' novels like Tinker, Tailor.... That's what's absent from elevating this book above the pack. Otherwise, it's not awful, it's just no better or worse than the other tripe out there that serves as a backdrop permitting us to identify better work.  And distasteful, as well as not credible, bits like Kate's having her coffee handground by an ancient Chinese woman (must be about 150 years old she opines) on an ancient handgrinder (or perhaps it's driven by a waterwheel) that she opines must be about 250 years old. Oh daahling, ratherrr!  Puh-leeze!

Actions speak louder than words so my action on the murderer being revealed midway though and then the plodding pace the plot then takes was to skip to the end to see if perhaps there was some twist inserted in the interim pages that resulted in someone else being the murderer. Nope. Instead, through an incredible plot device, the murderer instead comes to them and is about to shoot them when someone dives forward, windowglass shatters as simultaneously others enter the room and the murderer is off balance when the gun goes off.  Hmm, never heard of that happening in a mystery before.  What makes that device work is when the pacing just carries you along, otherwise it's a yawner at the end.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Set in 14th century England, Lord of Fairley, Jonathan is being forced to marry. The king has given him two weeks to find a bride, or one will be found for him. In an attempt to help him, his mother enlists the aid of Lady Alice, the daughter of one of her friends, while making it clear to Jonathan that Alice is not a suitable bride for him. Together, Alice and Jonathan make a list of all the eligible ladies at court and begin to plan ways for Jonathan to meet the ladies and determine their suitability.

The meddling by Margaret led to numerous humorous situations, awkward meetings, and two main characters both wondering why the other wasn't a suitable match. Both the plot and characters were relatively straightforward. There were no major plot twists to jump out at readers. The characters behaved true to character, again with few surprises. They were easy to like, if a bit blind to the manipulation going on around them.

This was a cute story. As far as historical romance goes, it was pretty light on historical details beyond the setting and a few period specific situations. As long as readers can picture a royal court, period dress, and a lack of modernity, there is no real need for background knowledge or even interest in historical events.

As it has been a while since my last historical read, this was a fun change of pace. I found myself grinning at Margarets antics and the reactions of both Alice and Jonathan to the maneuvering going on around them. It was an entertaining, quick read, full of humor and fun.

Kraus has honed his chops on lesser-length works and some of the stress of a full novel shows in his pacing and plotting: full bore for dozens of pages and ploddingly dull for dozens more. The corporeal and detailed sub-culture of grave robbers is splendidly realized, and the players are mostly intriguing if dull. Joey's experiences at school and at the hands of students and teachers alike are far too over the top to be believeable in any real sense. The villain of the story goes through so many self-mutilations, that he too, becomes just another unbelievable movie villain in the vein of Jason or Freddy instead of Anton Chigurh. At its condensed heart, Rotters just wasn't very interesting to me. It was like a sideshow exhibit where at first glance, you're wowwed, but the novelty wears off quickly and boredom sets in. At one point, Joey breaks his father's shovel handle. There is an entire monologue and a continuing story arc about how this incredible instrument had been with him for 20 years and had to be thrown away. The spade is the tool, not the handle. You wouldn't toss your favorite instrument because it needed a new shaft. You'd get a new one and keep using it. This book is the same way. The focus was far too prevalent on the handle, and much less on the part that mattered most. On a parting note, as a parent, this is definitely not for kids. Though targeted toward teens, the language is vile and content morbidly graphic. I'd never recommend this to a 14-year old.",0

Twelve-year-old Andi Boggs and her friend Colin are thrilled to be attending a prestigious science camp at a university in Kildeer, Ohio.

Andi and Colin, being extremely curious and fairly fearless, decide to put their investigative prowess to good use, and in true Nancy Drew-esque fashion, they get themselves into pickles and seemingly impossible situations pretty often.

(I read the whole thing on a 3 hour flight this past weekend). The characters have good hearts and positive goals and the book is clean and safe for young readers.  Lessons about integrity and honesty are sprinkled throughout the story but they are underlying themes more than overt lessons.  In addition to the mystery, there are good moments of both humor and drama, creating a very well rounded reading experience for any kid.

Brainy lab scientist Laura Manning has got a two big problems 1) she has to present the findings of her lastest project to the broard in a little over one week and 2) that would be easier if she didn't have sexier-than-sin Jay Cutler as her lab partner, all added to the fact that someone is out to get their secret files on the project by any means. So exactly how are they going to test their 'pleasure control' drug without anyone finding out their results before they present them to the board? -on themselves of course! Laura thinks that this is all in the name of science, but Jay has other ideas and after the 'experiments' are over, he's thinking of a more permanent relationship. But, ""Wildman"" Jay Cutler has really got his work cut out for him because Laura has a hard time believing it's her that he wants and not because he was under the influence of the pleasure drugs.

This is a really good debut. A very hot book. If your looking for lots of  scorching hot love scenes in a contemporary then this one is for you.  But my biggest gripe is the length, which is a little over 200 hundred pages with large type. I think the author could have added another 100 pages easily (perhaps it's the fault of the editors?). It was just over too fast for me and the overall scenes could have been more descriptive. I did enjoy it though and I'll definitely be getting the sequel. There's lots of room for improvement, but I think that Fox has a good start.

A very good short and heavy-on-the-love-scenes contemporary read.",0

Books_5,5,OR,"In `Talk Before Sleep' Elizabeth Berg displays the dynamics of the female friendship in such a moving and realistic way that this could be a true story, only it's not.  Berg explains that she wrote the story to help sort out her experiences during her own friend's death, and this connection between herself and her characters keeps them real and alive.  You will not often find a book in which the characters so confidently propel the story forward.
Ruth is dying of caner, it's plain and simple.  Though she toys with the idea of `curing' herself, it's pretty apparent that she will be leaving her friends before she should have to.  But like so many of Berg's books, this story is really about  Ann, Ruth's maternally-inclined friend, who temporarily sacrifices her husband and daughter to care for Ruth in her home.  While Ann is waiting on Ruth hand and foot (emotionally, physically and medically) there is plenty of time for flashbacks that take the reader through the women's friendship; through divorces and children and all the messy stuff that life is made of.  While Ruth's other friends also play intricate parts in the story, the focus really is on Ann and what she will choose to retain from her friendship with Ruth and this phase of her life.
Even though the subject is somewhat grim, I enjoyed reading this book.  One thing that is always consistent in Berg's writing is that she doesn't skip over the less-attractive parts of the human nature, so when you're reading you find yourself easily relating to one or more of her characters.  Reading is so often such a solitary thing, but when it becomes interactive it stays with you.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"""It is the place that confronts me with the fact that truly accepting love, forgiveness, and healing is often much harder than giving it""

The story of the prodigal son is one of the most prominent parables Jesus tells in the Gospels. A young man rejects his father, takes his inheritance, and foolishly spends it. The son finally decides to return home hoping that his father will forgive him and accept him back as servant. Unexpectedly the father doesn't even wait for an apology. The father runs out to his son and throws him a huge banquet.

This parable is both comforting and infuriating. It's comforting to see the unconditional love of the father, yet infuriating that the father doesn't ask for an apology or make him work back his favor.

A lot of Christians today live in this paradox. They love the unconditional love of God but are irritated when God shows so much love and mercy towards our enemies. We even do not like to accept undeserved grace. Legalism is born from this idea that we must earn back God's favor and fortune. ""One of the greatest challenges of the spiritual life is to receive God's forgiveness."" Our hearts need not to be focused on searching for God or loving God more. We need to allow God to love us.

Nouwen spins the parable a bit in this book. We always look at where fit between the sons: are we the lost son that returns or the stubborn brother that doesn't love? Nouwen challenges us to think about the father. Yes, in the parable the role of the father is the Lord, but God commands us to be like Him. Are you capable of loving like the father? Accepting and forgiving without an apology?",0

Books_5,5,OR,"The Adventures of Pinocchio is a classic story about what happens to a foolish puppet who does not listen to the wise advice of others and who disobeys his unselfish father Geppetto.  From the moment he comes to life Pinocchio causes trouble.  He chooses not to listen to the Talking Cricket, a black-bird, a Parrot, and a Fairy with blue hair.  Pinocchio encounters a (supposedly) lame Fox and a (supposedly) blind Cat who dupe him into putting money in the (alleged) Field of Riches.  After skipping school Pinocchio narrowly escapes a vicious police dog and a hungry green fisherman.  Pinocchio becomes a donkey (Collodi makes good use of symbolism here!) as a result of his visit to Funville.  The donkey becomes lame after tripping in a circus act.  A man comes along to purchase the lame donkey so the animal's skin can be used to make a drum.  After being thrown into the sea with a stone around his neck the donkey changes back into a puppet.  Pinocchio is then swallowed by a shark and discovers that his father has suffered the same fate.  Father and son both escape and Pinocchio becomes a real boy.

Having been a fan of hers from her first novel, The Raven Prince, I was delighted to pick up this newest tale of love, loss, and redemption. While this book is the tenth in the series, I am ashamed to say I have missed the last two or three, and wasn't confused at all when I picked this one up, so Duke of Sin can absolutely be read as a stand alone.

  Montgomery has returned from his exile with a score to settle. Hoping to gain redemption and ruin those who had wronged him, Montgomery ventures into a seedy underbelly. Bridget Crumb, Montgomery's newest housekeeper, has secrets and her own agenda. In a world filled with intrigue and never knowing who your friends or enemies truly are, Bridget and Montgomery find kindred spirits within one another. Only Hoyt can have this mysterious Duke find common ground with a destitute, secretive housekeeper who ultimately find their happily ever after.

  As I mentioned before, I had missed a few of the last novels. Boy, am I fixing this ASAP. Hoyt's worlds are just so nuanced and layered, and once you start it all just clicks. Romantic to its core, Hoyt writes unique characters, each and every time, which I adore. No cookie cutter heroine or hero, their traits and characteristics give you an insight into who they are, their motivations, and ultimately their fates.

Books_5,5,OR,"Mine is the Night by Liz Curtis Higgs is set in historic Scotland in the 1700 circa and based on the book of Ruth.  I had not read other book before reading ""Mine is the Night"", but I really don't think it mattered. I had a hard time getting into the book at first. It took me several chapters before I really started enjoying it, but once I got into it I loved it and had a hard time putting it down. Now it may have just been me and not having a lot of time to put into it at first and not just the material itself. The author did an excellent job of researching the area and the subject material. It is a true love story: a daughter-in-laws love for her mother-in-law but mostly her love of God. She devoted her life to God and He led her paths and because of her devotion she was blessed beyond anything she could imagine.
The characters were real and believable, the setting was beautifully described and the story was wonderful. The book was pretty long to read and took me a while to get through it but part of that was the limited amount of time I had to spend on it.

Books_5,5,OR,"I have been on Eugene Peterson kick recently. The more books that I read from him, the more I am drawn to his writing. He is wise, earthy, and poetic, a wonderful combination. Reversed Thunder: The Revelation of John and the Praying Imagination (1988) was the most recent.

In Reversed Thunder, Peterson explores the creative and imaginative language of St. John in the last book of the Bible. In my experience, many books about the Revelation of John attempt to provide a key to the events of the book as a type of apocalyptic road map. In other words, many books claim to have found the key to the end times and are eager to share their findings. This book is refreshingly different.

In the introduction, Peterson wrote, ""I do not read the Revelation to get additional information about the life of faith in Christ. I have read it all before in law and prophet, in gospel and epistle. Everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the previous 65 books of the Bible...I read the Revelation not to get more information, but to revive imagination."" Later: "" I have taken the position that this book does not primarily call for decipherment, as if it were written in code, but that it evokes wonder, releasing metaphors that resonate meanings and refract insights in the praying imagination.""

To be honest, this is the first thing I have read about the book of Revelation that I have actually benefited from, actually enjoyed. Peterson, a poet in his own write, writing about the poetry of St John is a lovely gift. If you are someone who has been confused by the book of Revelation, I would commend Reversed Thunder to you.  It is well worth the time.",0

Books_5,1,OR,"I bought this book on the strength of the reviews I read in Amazon, and all I can guess is that these reviewers are friends of the author because this is not a good book at all. My nine year old daughter and I read it together and she was very upset by the constant ridiculing of Elsie, the fact that the author had to restate over and over again what a freak she was, as fat as a circus act, can't look at her feet, has multiple chins, etc.  Okay, we get it, she's fat!  Now can we get on to the humanity of the child?  The other girls, including the narrator, were unlikeable for so long that we almost didn't care when they started to realize Elsie was a person with feelings.  And my daughter was very concerned with Elsie's mother's abuse of her, and very much hoping the mother would come to some kind of understanding of her daughter by the end.  I read the last two chapters before she did, and when I told her that no such event occurred she refused to read the end of the book.
As a writer myself, I was disappointed by the author's lack of a grip on story structure.  The characters had very little arc, and there were no likeable characters to relate to.  In addition, the utterly terrifying chapter where the children are kidnapped by a truck driver and taken outside the city limits has no place in a book like this.

Books_5,5,OR,"No historian covers financial subjects as well as Ron Chernow. This book on Hamilton, as well as his previous efforts on John Rockefeller (Titan) and JP Morgan (The House of Morgan) are thoroughly researched, clearly written and offer entertaining reading, despite covering complicated topics.

  One reviewer suggested that Chernow was more comfortable in the 19th century than the 18th and I suppose that is true.

  But this book, in my view, is superior to Titan. In Titan, I felt Chernow was to some extent a slave to chronology. He seemed determined to devote about a chapter to every period of Rockefeller's life. When Rockefeller retired in his 40s, Titan lost a lot of its focus. Rockefeller lived to be 90, and I felt a lot of the second half of that book was padding.

  With Hamilton as a subject, there was no way for the author to fall into that trap again. Hamilton's origin and youth in St. Croix are still shrouded in mystery, and, not to spoil the ending, but I assume most readers are aware of Hamilton's rather sudden demise at the age of 49.

  That of course was too bad for Hamilton, but it makes for a more exciting book. We see Hamilton as a grown man and soldier in the American Revolution by chapter three and then leading an eventful live that makes for a lively biography, when the author is up to the task.

  As Chernow most certainly is.

  This book took me somewhat by surprise. I don't know what is next for Mr. Chernow, but I actually was expecting, after Rockefeller and Morgan that he would do a biography of Carneige.

Books_5,5,OR,"I found this book exciting from beginning to end.  There are those who thought the first section long and boooring, and I disagree.  I honestly wanted to know all I could about the principle figures, and author Laura Hillenbrand obliged.  The people she introduces to us are real, breathing, fleshed-out people with concerns and agendas we can understand, thanks to her detailed expositions.  We can see the extravagant extrovert entrepeneur Charles Howard who becomes Seabiscuit's owner, the quiet, non-smiling trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper should be great in the role), the tough but literate jockey who has a life filled with his share of misery ahead, and above all, the unlikely horse who captured the public's imagination and inspired more columns of newsprint in 1938 than did Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, or Mussolini.
We get an understanding of the times, still depression-era with clouds of war gathering, and why a hero to ease the extreme stress of the time was necessary.  We learn much of the unpretty side of the lives lived by the jockeys.  We get the flavor of bordertown Tiajuana in the days of U.S. prohibition and anti-gambling legislation.
But the absolute highlights for me were Ms. Hillenbrand's colorful race descriptions.  I was able to picture the running of each important race and these descriptions were suspenseful.  In fact, Laura Hillenbrand's ability to keep the reader on the edge of one's seat is a welcome treat in non-fiction.
Now if you're just not at all interested in horses or horse racing, you're probably not even reading this, and if you are, I'd suggest getting the book from the library.  But for the average person who has even the mildest interest in the topic, this is abolutely a rewarding read.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I was reluctant to try this process, feeling a bit snobby as a mid-career artist with a BFA and MFA in painting. I was leery of sappiness of this program. But finding myself frustrated with my work, feeling too tightly wound and over analytical, it was just the anecdote I needed. In some ways this program is the counterbalance to my MFA program which I finished 15 yrs ago and left me firmly planted in my brain - thinking, thinking, thinking - over thinking. This book helped me to create again through my intuition and to trust my instincts. I'm certainly not suggesting that thought and analysis are not important integral parts of art making which is at its core problem solving. But I do agree with the premise that artistic ""block"" stems from living too much in your brain.

The book gives you simple weekly and daily exercises that are reflective and thoughtful. There is plenty of talk of ""god"" or ""spirit"" ""source"" or ""universe"" but it also clarifies that you may simply substitute in ""creative intuition"" or ""muse"" or some such term if you are not comfortable with the religious undertones. For me this was uncomfortable at first, given that I was totally in my rational head, but this sort of leap of faith is just what I needed. Some of the exercises did not apply as well to me, but I can almost always find some benefit, even if small. Many are cathartic.

As early as the second millennium B.C., a Chinese criminal's family was punished as harshly as the criminal himself. Around 100 B.C. the people were grouped in units of 5 and 10 households, carrying out mutual surveillance and mutually responsible for each other's conduct. In the case of minor offenses, the criminal's family would be exterminated to between 3 - 5 degrees of association; with serious offenses this was extended to 9 - 10. This principle remained a mainstay of the Chinese judicial system until 1911, and also gave rise to powerful traditions of clan loyalty and fear of speaking out openly that is still an inhibition today.

Even media in today's China base reporting in line with this fear. Interviewees are often ""led"" to follow the central ideology of the party and to express personal views defined by these principles.

Thus, Xinran's accounts from those in the Cultural Revolution, the Great Leap Forward, the Long March, etc. is not able to convey the immensity of these tragedies.

Notheless, some of the interviews were of particular interest. One first involved a teacher at a Gobi Desert construction/military site. She received no raises for 30 years, supervised self-study until 11 P.M., and sometimes helped the children home during severe weather. Desks were made from mud covered with straw.

Altogether, incredible indicators of internal strength and stoicism. However, for broader perspectives I recommend ""Mao,"" by Jung Chang, and ""Chinese Lessons,"" by John Pomfret.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Why you should read it: I love the idea behind parallel worlds, and Amy Nichols gives readers something even more interesting  we get to see the couples from both parallel worlds! While You Were Gone is the sequel to Now That You're Here, and in this installment we get to see the other Danny and Eevee. The author did a fantastic job in differentiating between the two Dannys and the two Eevees. I recommend this for any fan of parallel-universe stories and YA.

INTERVIEW WITH AMY NICHOLS

How was writing this version of Danny and Eevee?

Amy: Writing this Danny and Eevee was both challenging and rewarding. The first book gave me hints at who these parallel characters were, but I didn't really come to know them until working on the second or so draft of While You Were Gone. Eevee was more difficult to get a lock on than Danny. Once I understood her relationship with art, though, her part of the story came together. Danny I understood from the start, but I didn't anticipate how his story would affect me emotionally. He really broke my heart. At one point while writing I had to walk away from the computer and go have a good cry.

What would the other ""you"" be like?

Amy: I recently returned from The Schrodinger Sessions, a workshop in quantum physics for science-fiction writers put on by the Joint Quantum Institute at the University of Maryland, so right now I'm totally geeked out on science. I just know one of my parallel selves didn't get bored with science in high school, but rather pursued a career in it and is actively exploring all the weird and unexplained things about her universe.

Books_5,5,OR,"Books about successful technology companies are usually written by the entrepreneurs who founded the companies. It is truly remarkable for a book about a company which has grown from nothing to one of the largest computer companies in the world, written by an employee with a HR background and another employee with a diversity background. However, that is what we find with this book by Gina Qiao and Yolanda Conyers, suggesting that the key features of the company are at least as much tied up in its attitude towards employees and diversity as they are in the actual products the company sells.

The book describes a company which began with a group of Chinese scientists who had no commercial experience. Starting by renting out their expertise, then becoming distributors for international computer brands, then creating a Chinese-language motherboard, Legend Computers gradually grew to a position of dominance in the Chinese market before changing its English name to Lenovo and turning its ambitions towards a global market.

Many international companies have suffered culture shocks trying to take over Chinese companies; this book described the culture shocks Lenovo faced digesting the acquisition of the IBM personal computers business. A typical multinational company has a headquarters and dominant culture in one country; Lenovo has chosen not to pursue that route. It has adopted English as its language of businesses, requiring a significant sacrifice on the part of its founders and original staff. In different parts of the world, local culture prevails, rather than a monolithic head-office-imposed culture.

This book describes one way in which a truly international company can succeed, but it requires a lot of trust-building and willingness to sacrifice ones own interests. According to the authors:

We don't just say nice words about cultural diversity; we live it. That is the Lenovo Way.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Several of the science fiction ""classics"" I have read recently have proven to be rather less than classic for me. However, War of the Worlds is not one of them. I found it to be enjoyable, interesting, with an ability to keep me interested and engaged.

I was surprised when I started the book that it is NOT like the Orson Wells version of radio and movie fame. This is set in England at the end of the 19th century. This definitely limits the defensive abilities of the Earthlings compared to the movie. It is also part of what makes it interesting, because the Martians react much differently than the movie version as well. They are slower, more definite in their movements, and more connected between landing spots. Also, there are only ten landing spots for the Martians, it seems, rather than the world-wide invasion of the movie version. In fact, one area that left me questioning was what the rest of the world was doing while this went on in southern England?

The sample section of the book ""The Map of the Sky"" should have been left out, in my opinion. It was pompous and self-important, and was not in any way enjoyable, nor did it succeed in making me want to read a book that obviously was merely a ""tag-along"" story with little interest of its own.

The writing style was excellent, fast-moving overall though not without some hefty explanation sections. Grammar, spelling, word use, all are what one would expect from a consummate professional. I held off reading this book for quite a while after I downloaded it, in the fear that it would be another disappointing ""classic"".

Books_5,3,OR,"My theory is fiction writers (especially regarding their first novel) is analogous to my theory on psychiatrists.  Every psychiatrist I know has gone into the profession to learn more about their own particular psychosis.  Likewise, every author writes his first novel to exorcise his secret fantasies.  If this is indeed the case, Schickler is one messed up dude.

Each story is about a character's search for a lover and ultimately acceptance the taciturn landscape of a Manhattan apartment building - the Preemption.  We are introduced to each character in terms of their principal personal flaw, be it physical or emotional.  (What is Schickler's own personal flaw?  Perhaps he had both an unsightly birthmark and total insecurity about a childhood loss).  Each of these flaws is at the core of Schickler's stories.  The stories focus on the pursuit of the opposite sex.  We eavesdrop on each characters fantasies and insecurities.  (I think Schickler must secretly desire to order a gorgeous travel writer into his jalopy).  One thing is for certain, Schickler idolizes beautiful women.  Every woman in the book is gorgeous and lubricious.  The most developed character (and thus - according to my theory - the character most closely resembling Schickler) is a stock trader with deviant sexual practices that I won't reveal (suffice to say Schicker's dates had better be suspicious of nice diners).

In the end, Kissing in Manhattan is clearly Schickler's own little personal fantasy with names changed to protect the innocent.  It's a book about losers scoring the knockout babe, about dazzling women allowing themselves to be dominated by eccentric men, and ultimately about ONE man's quest to find sexual satisfaction and acceptance of his personal shortcomings.

Books_5,4,OR,"I appreciate this book on so many levels, I don't know where to even start this review. The Life List by Lori Nelson Spielman is a study of a person's transformation from a life being led to a life worth leading. The journey, however, is not without its own set of trials and tribulations.

When we meet Brett, the main character, she is the picture of success with the entire package of successful trappings: friends, love, professional achievement, and a life in the great city of Chicago.  It is only when Brett's mother passes away from cancer that the layers begin to peel away and we see what's going on beneath the surface.

To further exacerbate the situation, Brett is fired from her job by a sister-in-law who receives a promotion in the family business that had been promised to Brett. Through a series of events, it comes to Brett's attention that it was, in fact, her mother who has orchestrated some of the events Brett is being forced to deal with. The biggest and seemingly most undoable is for Brett to look back on a list of goals she made when she was just 14 and as is stipulated by her mother's attorney, in order to receive the inheritance from her mother, she must complete ten of the items on the list immediately. Dealing with the list and some of the goals penned as a young girl seems, well, difficult and impossible (get a horse?) particularly since she is in a state of grief.

Working through the list at first is challenging but watching her grow and evolve as she tackles each item, is miraculous, amidst surprise upon surprise but I will leave those surprises to be discovered by the reader.

Erie, scary, and terrifying; if I had to use three words to describe this book, that would be it. Robert A. Heinlien the classic Science Fiction author once quipped ""One man's theology is another man's belly laugh."" Of this book I would state, ""One man's perversion is another man's pleasure."" This book will hit both, depending on who you are and your sensibilities.

This book is a collection of short stories, written by characters who are on a writer's retreat. They all responded to an ad to ""give up three months of your life and create the masterpiece you have always said you would"". Each of the 18 respondents had an idea of where they would be going - to a large country estate, a camp in the woods; yet the reality is they get locked into an old ornate theatre house. They have food, shelter, and facilities, yet all doors are locked, all windows bricked over and no way out.

From there the book becomes a cross between Fear Factor, Survivor and your most feared horror story. We see the depths to which people will descend to achieve fame and riches. Palahniuk, during the current book tour, was reading the first story called `Guts' and to date there have been 63 people who have passed out with many people being injured falling into book cases in book stores.

They're trying to convince you that they are honest or highly creative or a really, really involved parent.  To paraphrase the bard, ""I think thou tries to prove themselves too much.""  Whenever someone tries hard to sell themselves, to sell you on a notion of who they are, they are almost always never that person.  That's all you can take away from one of those ambushes with any certainty.  Why do I bring it up?

This book is the exact opposite experience.  Brett is never trying to convince you of anything.  Story after story, she is nothing but humble and candid.  It's really what elevates the book.  It never reads too preachy and she never claims to know anymore than what her experiences have brought her.  And, so many of her lessons come from those she has watched and studied over the years.  Her time spent as a reporter works so nicely in this book.  She is in every story, but never demands the attention or the spotlight.  And, she never once tries to turn this into an ""issues"" book.  She mentions her own terribly troubled past only when necessary and only in the increments needed to move the story along.  This, I think, allows her own quiet yet clear voice to shine throughout.  Simple, yet elegant.  She must be one heck of a lady.  She never tries to convince me of it, but it's what I walk away with.  Nice, nice piece of writing.

Books_5,1,OR,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them.",0

I chose to purchase this book on audio and loved the narration.  I felt as if I could feel Winston's thoughts as he made a journey to question the life that he was living and question ""the party.""  This book reaffirmed my love for the freedoms that I enjoy in so many different ways - the freedom to love, to travel, to have a family and friends, to ask questions, to write and acknowledge my feelings, to READ!  This world that Orwell created, and described in such realistic detail, was a nightmare and was in such contradiction to the democratic freedoms that I know.

I think that what struck me the most was the love affair that Winston shared with Julia.  That it was forbidden was horrible, but the lengths that they had to go to be together and to hide their relationship was astounding. Winston risked everything to trust Julia, and he did so with full force, with everything that he had.

The optimist in me hoped for an overthrow of this world that was described in Nineteen Eighty-Four.

Books_5,5,OR,"It's tough to imagine someone writing a hilarious recounting of her struggles with OCD, scrupulousity and anorexia, but crafty girl Jennifer Traig has done just that.  The humor here is burst-out-loud funny.  Ms. Traig has a true ear and eye for finding the humor in any story.  And - that's the thing...some of these stories are - humor stripped away - pretty darn bleak.  When Jen's parents yank her out of school before the end of her junior year, you know things are pretty out of control.  The author - thankfully able to look back with perspective, sanity and health intact - is cognizant enough to concede the point.

Ms. Traig gives a lot of credit and support to her family for putting up with her over the years.  My favorite passage in that regard is this one:

""...but as I grew older, crazier and more religious, I felt as though I didn't blend in anywhere.  I was just so weird.  I didn't even fit in my own family.  This was largely my doing.  I'm the one who caused it...My parents had done everything right, ruling the house by dictatorship, a method that works so well for much of the Third World.  It didn't work for me.  Every day, I was stirring up insurgencies, issuing fatwas. declaring holy war on the whole...family.""

Now, that's a chick who can seriously write.  Excellent stuff, Jen.

One quibble about the industry reviews at the top of this page...where Publisher's Weekly says ""In this 1970s memoir, Traig describes how, from the age of 12 until her freshman year at Brandeis..."".  This is incorrect.  The author makes clear in the book that she went (at least Freshman year) to UC Berkeley.  Her PhD is from Brandeis.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"Margaret OMalley, a 13-year-old girl living in the small mining town of Victory, Arizona, has just found out that her father, a whistle-blower geologist, not intimidated by Victory Fuels bad practices, has been sentenced to death for arson and murder by the vindictive Judge. Desperate to help her father and save his life, Margaret is assured by her best friends grandfather that she has the special ability to do so.

Charlies grandfather, Joshua Garrett, has a complicated history with Victory and the coal mining company that founded it. The Garrett family moved to the dry desert climate of Arizona to alleviate young Prestons asthma, but when Frederic Garrett went to work in the mine, the family began to experience another form of hardship and danger. Frederic Garrett and his friend Aristotle Agrippa, along with many other miners, take on Victory Fuels, but the cost is high.

Decades later, their actions result in John OMalleys conviction.  The secret, both OMalley family and Joshua Garrett kept, is that they are able to time-travel. Grandpa Joshua hopes that sending Margaret back in time to the moment his friend Luke Agrippa becomes the hard-hearted Lucas Biggs will save her father and rectify past wrongs.  But Grandpa Joshua and Charlie quickly learn that trying to change the past is not enough, so they turn their attention to find a plan to save Lucas Biggs

The threatening execution of John OMalley subsidizes the story with painful strain, but hopefulness, and ethics in standing up for what is right, resisting corruption makes up for that tension and pain. Despite the OMalley ability to time-travel, the elements of fantasy are actually kept to a minimum, bringing the story to a factual resolution. The story starts with these questions and takes readers on an exciting adventure within the heart of several genuine characters.",0

Books_5,3,OR,"This was an interesting book.  There were parts that ran a little dry for me, as a duffer who knows next to nothing about neuroscience.  It was very accessible, easy to understand and follow; if anything, the dry parts were due to more depth than I needed.  But it simply showed the author's careful adherence to due diligence, offering solid evidence for the conclusions she drew.  The writing was clear and professional and easy to read; there were a couple of very fun optical illusions in the early chapters, and I wish there had been more visuals, more images and graphics, for the reader's sake, but such would be unnecessary; merely fun.

I was fascinated by the concept of the book, that optimism is a necessary and beneficial adaptation in our species, provided it doesn't go too far.  I am a former and still occasional optimist, of the type that went too far; I smoked for more than fifteen years, somehow managing to ignore the obvious damage I was doing to myself, and the fact that two of my grandparents died of tobacco-influenced lung cancer.  Because surely those things wouldn't happen to young, strong me!  Surely the damage that smoking does to a person was mitigated by my own magnificence and dumb luck!  As I have aged, however -- and particularly as I have spent the last dozen years trying to teach English to American teenagers in a public school -- my optimism has decreased markedly.  But it was in some ways very inspiring to me to read about the benefits of continued *reasonable* optimism, especially coming from a scientist rather than a self-help snake oil salesman.  I believe I will try to look on the bright side -- but not be blinded by it.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"""My secret, my obsession is worse than any of theirs. To contain it, I do the only thing I can. I lock myself up. And in doing so, keep myself, and everyone else, safe.""

This was an edgy book that explored the dark places we try to keep locked up inside of us, since they are not in compliance with societal norms or potentially are illegal. Who among us doesn't have these secrets? Of course, most of us don't go to the extreme of locking ourselves up for the safety and protection of others.

The book was a quick, but very gripping and entertaining read. The story is told from several points of view which makes for an interesting read as well. The pace moved along at a good clip, and then picks up as climax is nearing (no pun intended). Excellent suspense and many emotions are drawn out of the reader.

I was not familiar with the author prior to this book. I don't read in the genre she specializes in, erotica, but this book definitely falls more in the thriller genre, and I would read more of her books with this sort of a cross over. She is a talented writer.

I am not familiar with camming, but would expect that she got that pretty accurately. That aspect of the book was a nice twist. Not only does the main character have psychotic urges, and a dark past, but because she has locked herself up, she has become one of the country's premier web cammers to support herself. That combination makes for a very entertaining character who drew many different emotional responses from me.

Books_5,5,OR,"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only ""Jane Eyre."" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.

This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic ""A Room of One's Own."" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.

This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after ""Jane Eyre"", ""Shirley,"" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic ""Madame Bovary"" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.

One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.

The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.

This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.

Books_5,3,OR,"Elmore Leonard has been inordinately successful getting his books adapted to the screen. Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is as good as any Leonard adaption. Seeing his characters with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens.

Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writers to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novellas loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other characters get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan works much better when it departs from the stories told by the show.

I take as poor a view of mining companies as Leonard does, but the coal plotline gets a bit preachy. Again, Justified better captures the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for jobs and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders.

If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who has seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book.",0

His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views.

Books_5,5,OR,"I vaguely recall reading some articles by Mr. Safire, but I've never read any of his books before.  Well, I shall certainly remedy that.  If Scandalmonger is any sign, William Safire might just be one of the most able writers in the US today.
Seriously, it must have been six months since I've last enjoyed a novel as much as I have enjoyed this one.  Written with clear, powerful and well thought of prose (In the afterwords, Safire reveals some of the tricks that he used in order to convey the atmosphere without falling into the use of anarchonisms), this book is always thrilling and often witty, for those of us who enjoy subtle, sharp irony.
You don't have to reach the appendixes in order to realise the width of Safire's knowledge of the topic.  Safire is clearly very well versed with the history of the period, and it shows.  Not a very descriptive writer, Safire clearly knows alot about the personality of each and evry character in the novel.  Writing with a Historian's dedicacy, even Safire's lies are rarely more than half truths.
The Pacing and prose of Scandlemonger are perfect.  It is a page turner, very well written and planned.  Safire never lets his grip loose, and every word counts.
The parallels between the US of the 1790s-1800s and the US of the 1990s-2000s are overwhelming, and surprisingly, you feel some appreciation to the history of journalism.  I think it is impossible to read Scandalmonger without thinking about Monica Lewinski, but the novel will still be every bit as good when Lewiski, like Sally Hemmins, will be left as no more than an ancedote in US history.
I can not recommand Scandalmonger enough.  In each and every aspect it is a masterpiece of fiction.  In one word: TRIUMPH.",0

After finishing this book, I tried to determine exactly what I didn't love about it. It took me a moment to put my finger on it. There was an entertaining main character, lots of action, some cool magic, and even a bit of romance. I think the problem was that I didn't connect with the main character.

Harry was so...I don't know. And that's the point. The book is written in Harry's first-person point-of-view, and Harry repeatedly reminds the reader that he is a skilled wizard. He also reminds the reader, on a number of occasions, that those who are privileged to see into his soul are generally shocked or terrified at what they see. Through Harry's accomplishments, I saw that Harry is indeed a skilled wizard. But I never saw what was inside his soul. I want to know about his dark past. I want to know Harry.

On a couple of occasions in the book, Harry claims to struggle with his choices. He wants to do the right thing, but the power of his magic draws him toward darker things. I know about these struggles because Harry told me so explicitly. Never once I did I actually see him make so much as a questionable decision. He did the right thing; he fought for good. So all the rambling in his head about his dark past and about temptation was lost on me. I saw no inner turmoil. I saw only a good guy skilled in magic attempting to fight a powerful, power-hungry evil guy.

Without a backstory, this is a typical good versus evil book. So it didn't blow me away. I will read the second book in this series though, and I hope to see Harry making some tough decisions that show me the darkness he claims is inside him.",0

Books_5,5,OR,"I found the book to be very interesting and agree for the most part with the author.  However, I am not sure ALL murderers have had a bad upbringing where they were whipped or even abused.  I am sure there are cases where this is not so.  It would be interesting to examine more cases especially here in America.  I was raised by a half German and half English mom and was not abused much.  I turned out to be a happy and productive person.  I do not blame my mom for her abuses which were there but nobody is perfect and she grew up with the threat of the strap herself.  I do not see the purpose in blaming parents except in the cases described in the book.  To me I wonder if it is more of a German problem but I am probably nave to think that.  As stated in the book it is not limited to just one country.  I know from the parenting books out now (since I am a parent to two girls myself) in America the opposite is the case.  It is a fear to even raise a hand to a child because of the consequences.  Which is good.  My sister has perfectly mannered children who have never been harmed physically and I hope emotionally as well.  Although I do not know.  My children are not well behaved but they are allowed to be children and I try not to be permissive but it happens.  A very quick read for I read it in less than a week.  Nice read.  It kept me entertained.  A little too much on Hitler though and I did not care to read about the child murderer either.",0
Books_5,4,OR,"The title gives you the short version, now here comes the longer one.  I'm reading Ms. Scottoline's works in order, so this is number 5.  In Rough Justice, she reprises Mary DiNunzio's character from book 1 and if my notes are right, (Ms.) Bennie Rosata's from book 3 -- which is nice because we're really getting inside these character's personalities which adds to the fun.  The basic premise this time is that a guest hot-shot lawyer from out of town, Marta Richter, has just heard from her client, who, thanks to Marta's hard work, is heading toward a self-defense acquittal for killing an alleged carjacker, a confession that it was murder after all.  She immediately spends the rest of the book trying to get back at him (not too sure about the ""legality"" of that), with help from Bennie's associates Mary and Judy.  The plot is actually quite good, with a lot of twists and turns, culminating in a very good ending that had me turning pages late into the night.  A number of additional corpses prevent this from being all sweetness and light, yet I think the outcome seemed fitting.  My only gripe was that 2/3 of the book took place during such a bitter and deep snowstorm that roads were closed and cities crippled.  Yet Marta manages to drive back and forth from Philly to the Jersey shore (!), with all kinds of shenanigans there, while the troops back at the law firm are out all night pulling the same stunts, even interviewing people at 2 o'clock in the morning!
Anyhow, ""Rough"" is a welcome addition to the growing Scottoline repertoire; I'll certainly be back for more, and I can overlook a little bit of unlikely traipsing around by the women for a story this entertaining!  Try it.",0

I have read countless books on dating, trying to figure out what I have been doing  wrong, how/why I keeping picking/attracting the wrong partners, why there  has been so much resentment, conflict and bitterness in my past  relationships, etc.
After I read the book it all became crystal clear to  me.  I had been considering personality compatibility, but only in a  general way. Neither my partners nor I were ""bad"" people, we were  just the ""wrong"" people for each other.
Dr. Avila's book  enables you to ""type"" yourself, how to quickly size up others for  their ""type"" and my favorite features, WHERE to meet others of  your compatible type and HOW to attract and build relationships with them.  These techniques apply to BOTH opposite AND same sex friendships. Very  targeted, specific information, very rare in dating books.
I realize now  that by following the advice in other dating books, I was hanging out in  the wrong places to meet MY best type.
His theories sound rock solid both  from a psychological and common sense point of view.
I think that his  book settles once and for all the opposites attract, but do they stay  together debate.
Lastly, I commend Dr. Avila for going beyond the theory,  and putting the principles into practice by actually encouraging/helping  set up LoveType social groups. In fact, I am going to his book signing  tonight, to be followed by mingling and discussion of starting up a social  group in the Los Angeles area.  I'm REALLY looking forward to what might  come of it!

Books_5,3,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand I'm sure it will stay with me, if only because it has provided me with a vivid picture of what the mental life of somebody I know may be like. On the other hand I did not care for the writing ...

... starting with the title, whose intriguing promise is not in any way, that I can see, kept, Naturally the title brings to mind Sherlock Holmes. And the connection is indeed drawn in the book, which, very annoyingly to my mind, relates the main plot of the relevant Conan Doyle novel, which I would have been motivated to reread after all these years had it only been alluded to rather than completely revealed (and to no good purpose that I can see). And what does it have to do with THIS novel? Not much. Just about the only plot element that was keeping me interested was the detective mystery, but, bizarrely, this is blown up rather early in the game ... admittedly thereby introducing a different and also intriguing plot element, but not intriguing enough to assuage my disappointment at the demise of the detective element.

The writing is lacking also in that there are contradictions in the text and sometimes the characters do things that I simply could not believe.

The main problem with the writing, though, is one of the things that gives the book its strength, namely, conveying what I presume is an autistic-like mind. Unfortunately the author is not enough of a stylist to prevent me from mentally shouting, OK, enough already, I get it. It became tedious for most of my read.

I will credit the book and story with a strong double message: It shows that some people are capable of unconditional love (and some are not), and happiness is not to be found.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"When I first started this book, it was just not engaging at all.  Something about the writing style and the very slow start really distracted me and kept me from being interested.  It definitely picked up somewhere in the middle and builds up from there finishing with a very satisfying ending.  Not that it matters all that much, but this book has one of the best endings I've read in a while.
Though the story is very slow at times and pretty repetitive at others, some of the concepts in it are really cool and unique (for me at least).  Things like time dilation, major cultural and societal changes to the human race over time, physics, and economics all play pretty large roles in the book.  These are very well explained and really engage the reader, causing one to think about them in a way not really presented in many sci fi books of the genre.  Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that this novel kind of envelopes two recurring themes that are popular in contemporary literature; space warfare\travel, and futuristic dystopian fantasy.  While you are shown intense, high speed warfare in distant galaxies, the earth and its people are undergoing some massive changes and not all for the better.  It is definitely kind of an interesting dichotomy that once again sets this book apart from many others for me.
Over all, the only detracting factor that I can find in The Forever War is its slow start.  The characters are strong, though not completely fleshed out, the setting(s) are really interesting and distinct and the actually story from start to finish is awesome.  It's a relatively short read too so definitely give it a chance and see it through to the end if you can. I doubt you'll regret it.",0

Books_5,2,OR,"So, caveat of course - I did stop 1/3 of the way through the book, so it may well redeem itself later and come to a thrilling conclusion. I don't know, because I couldn't make it that far. Also, I think I missed one or more of the earlier books in this series. It seems like that might have been a prerequisite for liking the characters in this one, because none of them appealed to me. Mels, the heroine, was the most likeable but she still didn't grab me; she's stuck in a town she doesn't like and living with her mom and isn't doing anything about it. She's ""daring"" in that she doesn't wear a seatbelt, and nice in that she pays her debts and helps strangers in need, but that's about it. She's not striving for anything and has no greater plan of her own.

The hero and other male characters are all very JRWard-esque strong and uber-male and urban/gangsta, but not in a sexy way and again none of them really grabbed me. I wasn't rooting for anyone and wasn't worried about anyone. Unlike her Black Dagger Brotherhood series where the team is all about saving a community and innocents, in this series the cause (a fight between angels and demons) seems pretty self-centered. There may be some innocent caught in Hell that one of the angels is trying to rescue (again, must have missed that backstory in another book) but overall it seems the protagonists and antagonists are just trying to win a contest set up by the Maker in order to save their own souls.

Anyway - maybe if you read all the books in the series in order, and don't have any expectation of a good romance or quickly paced action, you'd enjoy it. I'll be skipping the rest of this series and waiting for her next.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I really loved reading this book.  I became  immersed in a foreign culture very dissimilar to mine in many of its strict gender behavior and religious expectations but, at the same time, composed of very human, very plausible characters with whom I could empathize.  Slowly getting to know the characters, piecing them together, and wondering who were the good and bad guys, all had me on the edge of my chair wanting to know more.  Particularly fascinating were the female characters and how each dealt with the constraints placed upon them in a society where a woman's sexuality is such a preoccupation that it has to be hidden and controlled, and where the males do not seem to generally take responsibility to control their own (although one of the main male characters was very sensitive to these issues and torn by guilt and angst by his own self-perceived transgressions against the true spirituality of Islam, and his desire to treat the woman he wanted with the highest regard).  Meeting strong women who wanted to develop themselves professionally in a male-dominated culture that generally blocked that from happening was refreshing and touched my heart.  I applauded them and those males who supported them, wishing to truly respect their intelligence and not exploit  or demean them (although there were those who did).  All of the characters were unique and very engaging, with the no-nonsense, dedicated and very wise investigator, Osama Ibrahim (was the name, Osama, chosen deliberately, to create a more balanced association with it?), being my favorite.  Also extremely fascinating was gaining entre into the desert environment, and modern man's attempt to master it and treat it as a wilderness adventure.

Books_5,4,OR,"While I saw the movie before listening to the audiobook, I must say that I still really enjoy the main character. He's one of those guys you love to hate, but he's trying so hard to do the right thing, even if it means defending a scumbag who deserves a lot worse. Of course, since I had seen the movie already, I had an idea how it was going to end, but couldn't remember the specifics. Perhaps thats a measure of a great crime drama: all the misdirection makes it difficult to know whodunit, allowing future rereads to be enjoyable.

But, back to the main character, Mickey Haller, I think one of the reasons this book was a breeze to listen to was because the main characters POV is so well written. You can tell that he has some baggage from his father, which is partly why he defends everyone, regardless if they're guilty or not. The fact that Haller knows his way around the legal system and uses it to his advantage to even get the guilty an innocent ruling just shows that he takes pride in his work, even if it labels him as someone who keeps the crime on the streets.

The plus to this audiobook was also the narrator, who was awesome in bringing all the different characters to life with his voice acting. Even if the story is told from the point of view of the eponymous Lincoln Lawyer, there are plenty of interesting people in this book, and each one certainly has a different sound to them. Its the attention to these details that differentiates a narrator just reading a book to you and a voice actor who can bring the events happening in the words hes speaking to life.

A great start to an interesting crime drama series, I give The Lincoln Lawyer 4.0 stars out of 5.",0

Books_5,3,OR,"Native Tongue is an enjoyable book which translates well to riding a train, something I do every day, an hour each way. The story is crafted well enough to keep you interested, the characters are colorful, the underlying message is a decent one, and the book as a whole stands up well as I look back on it. Having said that, there's something in the narrative which makes you wonder about the author, if he's really a homicidal maniac waiting for you to stumble into his back yard.

That statement might sound a bit off-the-wall. I suppose I should admit to having read a magazine article about him recently. The book moves from colorful, with a hint of darkness, to a little edgy for the wrong reasons after you read more about the guy. Still, that shouldn't (and doesn't) take away from the book, which is a good way to pass the time on the train ride into the city.

The story is about man's encroachment on the various Florida lands that should be reserved for wildlife as opposed to, say, condos and parking lots. To be sure, this is an ever-growing problem which looms on society's horizon, only getting bigger by the day. In typical American fashion, the author takes this stand only *after* establishing his own residence in the state. ""Do as I say, not as a do,"" has never been more prevalent.

But the book isn't terribly serious. It's a whimsical fiction story which is easy to chew through at a good pace. Hiaasen is a good writer, and keeps the narrative moving well through the book. A bit peculiar in spots, the story nevertheless runs cohesively from start to finish, pausing occasionally to let you laugh at yet another silly kink in the story's chain.

All in all, a good book that's worth the read. Will definitely buy more of this author's work.",0
Books_5,3,OR,"What I liked:  Alice in Zombieland is about a girl that finds out that her father wasn't really simply a mental case when he locked the family in at night to protect them from terrible creatures.  The monsters are real, and they're coming, and they will eat you.  Ali is reeling from the tragedy of losing her entire family while adjusting to her new reality where zombies exist and she can now see them.  Teaming up with others at her school, she must fight to prove that she's worthy of sharing their secrets and fighting the good fight.

What I didn't like:  The zombies in Alice in Zombieland are not zombies, but rather some type of soul-eating spirit monsters.  There is little of Alice in Wonderland to be found in this book.  At the beginning, I was under the impression that there would be more, but it quickly devolves to only tangentially related chapter titles and a main character with the same name.  Given that zombies and Alice in Wonderland are the two main reasons I picked the title up, it was a bit of a recipe for disappointment for me.  Also, the insta-love with Cole Holland was ridiculous.  Even though Showalter tried to explain it away with some sort of magical something or another, it turned me off their relationship for a big chunk of the novel.

Final thoughts:  Alice in Zombieland can be enjoyable, if you know what to expect.  Don't come in expecting a retelling of Alice in Wonderland in any form, nor true zombies.  Be prepared for the ridiculously executed insta-love and some heavy melodrama.  If you can handle these things and enjoy the characters, you can find in this novel a quite different take on the teens fighting evil theme.  I'll likely continue the series.",0

While there is some room for improvement with the pacing of the novel, the overall premise was amazingly creative. It features a wonderful blend of religious ideals with Kate's fictitious world. Kate has a wonderful way of pulling the reader into the world of Sword & Cross. I constantly found myself thinking I had only read about five pages, only to discover it was closer to twenty. This is due in part to how well Kate explores the world she has created. Every detail has been thought of, and is explained beautifully.

But by far, my favorite aspect has to be the characters. Luce is an interesting heroine. I am really interested to see how she develops since there is a lot of potential with her. And I can't wait to see more of her and Daniel. They are an interesting pair to say the least. While I love those two, it is Cam that really has my attention. He is an alluring mixture of good and evil. I am dying to learn more about him, and his overall role in the plot. In regards to secondary characters, Kate has created some of my favorites of all time, with Penn leading the way. They are funny, creative, and above all else, memorable.

Despite certain plot issues that need to be addresses, I have to say that I am pleased with this novel. It was highly creative, and left me wanting to know me. I can't wait to see what twists await me in the next book.",0
Books_5,3,OR,"I like Michael Crichton. A lot. I began a long time ago with the Andromeda Strain and that was a super thriller.

Dragon Teeth is readable, but it is not a stand out and certainly way below the standard that made him one of the most popular author of thrillers.

There are several reasons for this:

1) Crichton is generally excellent in giving you a deep understanding of the issues involved and leaves you enlightened and informed. For example, in Rising Sun he describes exactly how and why the Japanese company's surveillance cameras were superior and why American sleuths could not retrieve relevant images. In Disclosure he describes how the HR department functions and what is involved in cases of allegations of sexual harassment.

Dragon Teeth is supposedly similar with paleontology as the backdrop. I disagree. The background provided is cursory and a fifteen minute read on the topic on Wikipedia will leave you better informed.

2) Crichton is excellent with cliffhangers. Each chapter leaves you waiting to see what happened next. The pace is relentless the climax is tremendous. Dragon Teeth is distinctly ho hum. The descriptions could come from a travel brochure, the characters are not well developed, and there is little to no suspense.

In addition, there are loose ends. I will not say more because this would be a spoiler but one significant character introduced with fanfare leads you to believe that this character plays an important role in the tale. Instead this character then simply vanishes.

3) There are discrepancies which are jarring. For example, he describes the protagonist as having a full, luxuriant mustache. A sentence later he says that he had a clearly visible scar on his upper lip. The two are incompatible. He can have one or the other but not both.

Overall, this is a reasonably good read but not a thriller and nowhere near the standard one would expect from Michael Crichton.",0

Books_5,3,OR,"""Ape House"" is a light read that attempts to open the animal world to us by bringing the Bonobos Apes to life in an original way.

This is a story about a family of Bonobos, their caretaker scientist Isabel Duncan and a down to earth reporter John Thigpen. I will cover the plotting in a few words, it begins with the primate language laboratory being bombed and Isabel left badly injured, severe enough to end up in the trauma ward of the closest hospital. The Bonobos fall into the hands of a porn producer and are locked up in a house with cameras broadcasting their every move on cable television. Reporter John Thigpen covers the story while his personal life is on a down turn, his home life it is about to take a drastic change. The plotting gets meatier when Isabel is released from hospital and teams up with John to find out who targeted the laboratory, for what reason and what has happened to her family of apes.

The story explores in a far-fetched semi captivating manner, the issue of animal rights from the point of view of activists, scientists and the public. The plot takes a meandering course with a bit of action here and there mostly done by the humans, there are also subtle references to sexual activities amongst the apes and their unique methods of communication. I found this part satire and part morality driven tale was presented to us by a cast of lackluster and easily forgotten characters, maybe if the Bonobos had been given a greater role it would have left a more lasting impression. Unfortunately the book started strong just to peter out by the end, I was disappointed when the tale did not capture the apes' behaviour, gestures and emotions in a more detailed fashion.

Although the story was not what I had anticipated, I nevertheless enjoyed the change.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I love this book, I just do. From the original character names to the wholly original plot to that cover that screams, ""READ ME!"" It's hard not to fall in love with Laini Taylor's debut novel and I can see why this book has garnered so much attention. It is flawless written with lush words that fill the pages, enticing the reader deeper and deeper into the book.

Karou--I seriously just love that name--is a phenomenal lead. Seeing the world through her eyes was beautiful and exhilarating. She is the tip of the amazing-character-iceberg. I love her and Akiva. They are literary gold, and I cannot get enough of them. Just please, give me more. NOW.

There is something that is pure magic about certain books, and Daughter of Smoke and Bone has it. There are few books on my shelves I will reread because I am in awe of the way a writer places the words together to make a sentence full of enchantment. I can safely say this book has earned that distinction. Many books are good, have fun plots or witty characters, but it's the places in between the action, in between the dialogue, that draw me in. It's the space between the heartbeats of a novel that win me over and fuse with my heart.

For a book so large, the ending came entirely too fast. I was left desperate for more at the end, and with too many questions that really need answering. I suppose that is the mark of a great book--leave them panting for more, right? If that is the ultimate goal, Taylor has it in spades. I truly hope one day I get to meet Laini Taylor; her mind must be an amazing place to create such a wild, vivid story that has captured so many readers. I can only imagine she would be as charming and creative in person.",0

Books_5,1,OR,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quotes the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calories consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calories between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then goes on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calories than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pounds since 2006.

This is a misleading example and conclusion.  An increase of 570 calories (which I highly doubt in the first place), does not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption was close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day.

However, I do agree that these calorie studies are inaccurate, but not because calories don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which was a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meals reported on foods purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guests (who may have eaten food).

Books_5,5,OR,"Psychologist Daniel Hughes has done it again with his newest book, Attachment-Focused Parenting. In his highly-skilled and talented manner, Hughes has managed to take the complex terms and concepts of attachment theory and make it accessible for the reader. Hughes helps us to better appreciate that the parent-child relationship is a two-way interaction, with each being greatly influenced and affected by the other. Of equal importance, he helps the reader to see that parenting goes way beyond guidance and discipline; rather, both parent and child require a context for understanding what happens between them, and each is influenced by their own history.

Hughes relies extensively upon examples and real-life scenarios as he makes his points. In doing so, he appeals to a wide spectrum of parents. That is, he cites the example of a four-year-old who screams with frustration, while later addressing the parent-child struggles of a 16-year-old. Independent of age, however, the concepts Hughes lays out are universal for all children, regardless of age.

Get ready, though, as Hughes reminds us that the parent's own attachment history greatly affects the parent-child relationship. This certainly isn't new, as how often have we caught ourselves saying, ""I never thought I would say/do what my father/mother did..."" Without writing a self-help book for parents, Hughes proposes some questions and concepts parents should ask themselves about their own history, given the part it plays in raising their kids.

As a child psychologist who primarily works with foster and adopted children and their families, I continually deal with kids who have their own attachment issues to work through. While a professional can assist a child in this regard, much of the work to be done centers on the child's relationship with her parent, be it foster, adoptive, or birth. Because of this, Hughes' book will be at the top of my reference list for the parents I work with, but also for other professionals.",0

Living alone in a cramped, dirty trailer, he leads a hand to mouth existence.  Chronically unemployed, he has taken to poaching to put food on his table.

One morning, Moon hunts and wounds a deer.  Tracking the animal to a nearby rock quarry, he senses movement behind him.  Reacting instinctively,  he whirls and fires a single shot into the surrounding wood, and sees something brown crash to the ground.  Assuming he has downed the deer, he begins to walk towards the trees.  It is only after he is charged by the wounded deer that he realizes he must have shot something else.

When Moon investigates, he discovers the body of a young woman.  Struggling to stay calm, Moon conducts a search of  the area, and discovers the girl's belongings, along with a package containing some $80,000 in cash.  Moon, overwhelmed by events, decides to hide the body and take the cash.  Shortly thereafter, he finds himself at the center of a bizarre series of events, as the money's owners eventually trace it back to him.

Books_5,4,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book, the things that I liked were also the things that I didn't. Maddie for example, was this sweet girl-woman and throughout the book, it is revealed how much a victim this young girl really was. At the same time, I thought that is exactly what makes her such a complex character to read about. If this was reality, then I would not feel this way, because I think that her overcoming the abuse was so much a part of the story, it would be the furthest thing from entertaining for me to read. For this reason and a few others, one being the connection between Caden and Maddie that was choppy at times, I don't know if I would ever want to read this book again. There is definitely a difference  between the last two books by SM and the earlier ones in this series, one of the problems being that there have been huge breaks between books, and while I want to read a nicely finished book, this just caused me to forget and not care anymore.
I gave the book 4 stars because when Maddie and Caden were at odds with one another, it was written such that I really felt what they were struggling with and for that the author deserves credit. When they were reconciling, Caden showed absolutely the right amount of gentleness I wanted him too. Honestly,  the part where the conflict with his own family was not explained enough, I was  able to take at face value as I would not want to read pages and pages about the extremely violent circumstances of those times, a couple of sentences thrown in here and there were quite enough for me. All in all, a good addition to this series, but not a hot romance as I would like to have read from  SM.",0

Major Themes:
Marriage, mid-life crises, general discontent, maintaining your identity through motherhood

What I Loved:
- The very beginning of this one was just okay, but I liked it more and more the farther I read.
- You can really feel this bookthe simmering suburban discontent, everyone having an itch thats just waiting to be scratched, the restlessness that comes with sweltering summer days. Its like a sea of smoldering embers threatening to ignite at the slightest catalyst.
- The cast of characters is delightfully eclectic and everyone is dealing with their own issuesthe unhappily married housewife (Claire), the failing and desperate real estate agent (Don), the grieving lover (ABC), and the actor returning home to tie up loose ends (Charlie). And, best of all.
- Ruth Manetti (she deserves her own bullet)! This eighty-some year old pothead gives the best life adviceI decided she needs to be my shrink!

You see? Ruth says. This is why I like you more than anybody else. When I give you the straight dope, you don't reel off some optimistic bulls***.

- Bakopoulos nails the issue of women losing their identities during motherhood. I highlighted so many passages pertaining to this issue that made me think yes, thats exactly how it is. And, Im even more impressed given hes male!

What I Didnt Like:
The ending fizzled a bit and partially revolved around the storyline I was the least invested in. But, it didn't bother me that much because this book was about the journey and I enjoyed that immensely.

A Defining Quote:
Something happened to me, Claire says. I don't know what. I stopped wanting things. And now? he says. Now, she says, I just want.

Books_5,4,OR,"Let me just start out by saying that I read this book, and don't understand why it got so many negative reviews, or why its average rating is only 3 stars. I guess that's the great thing about listening to your gut and ignoring reviews.... many times people's reading experiences are so personal that it just doesn't pay to read a book based on others' reviews.
This book is basically a collection of different people's life stories. These are people Bronson handpicked to interview, based on how interesting or believable he found their story to be. All of the people interviewed have somehow found a more fulfilling, more rewarding life, but usually not before years of struggle. Many of these stories deal with career, but not all. It becomes apparent that often happiness is a tricky thing, to be found in places where you don't expect it.
One of my favorite stories was the one of the guy who was getting a PhD in English but then ended up becoming a chef. Another one I liked was about the guy who wanted to work in golf. I thought every one of these stories were interesting, and believable.
What I liked the most about this book was its desire to probe life and reality as they are, instead of getting bogged down in neat or too-simple self help explanations or methods. Believe me, I have read a few self-help books during challenging times. Believe me, they did not work. The reason, I think, is because often they provide you with too-ready theories of life instead of encouraging you to think for yourself to find the best solution for yourself. This book doesn't do that. Instead, it makes you realize (at least it made me realize) that achieving contentment is not as simple as we want to think, but it's something that's still possible with a lot of patience, time, and perseverance.

Books_5,3,OR,"I have never written a review before, but this book irritated me.  Entirely too much internal dialogue.  All 6 books leading up to this one were forward moving, action packed, weaving new sub-plots... not this one.  Like other reviewers I grew really tired of Mac and her immaturity (even though she tried to evolve out of it), and such strong emotions being dumped all together.  The emotional roller coaster finally made me motion sick.  I got really tired of the inside of Mac's head.  Dont ""tell"" me how she feels, ""show"" me how she feels.  And frankly, after 27 pages, i really ""don't give a frog.""  Actually, halfway through the last book I really didn't care what happened to anyone.  Not a good sign after 6 books (which I loved).
I think the series went too long, so the amount of backtracking that had to be done to allow for people who are too lazy to start at the beginning got really tiring.  I felt the for-shadowing for Barrows return was heavy handed so I didn't mourn his death at all, I just thought ""You Idiot!  He TOLD you don't expect things to die!"" and then was frustrated that she didn't hang around and defend his body so it wasn't eaten by the locals. If this was someone I cared so much for, and I thought there was the slightest chance he could come back, i would stand there spear in hand until his head rotted off. Highly unbelievable character actions.
I so loved the Highlander series that I was super happy she wove the characters into this one. I was glad to hear from the MacKeltars and Adam and all them.
In all, I felt the story ended too abruptly, slamming on the brakes and throwing me into the dashboard. I leave the series battered, bruised and sorely needing a dramamine.",0

Books_5,4,OR,"I am a fan of Doreen Owens Malek, her dialogue is witty and she steadily builds the romantic tension between her leads. Her novel, A Marriage of Convenience, is an enjoyable read albeit this is an older novel and there is a sense of the characters being behind the times in many ways.

Sharon Phillips returns to her father's ranch in California after his death, she is not happy to be in the Golden state though because she must face her first love, Taylor Braddock. Sharon fell in love with Taylor when she was only eighteen when she visited her father for his wedding to Taylor's mother. Taylor broke her heart and she has not been in contact with him since.

Taylor is a Vietnam vet (yes, this is dated) and he has had major difficulties adjusting back into civilian life. He was a POW and he deals with his memories with alcohol and a bad temper. He is about ten years older than Sharon and he finds her sweet and innocent, way too innocent for the likes of him so he sends her on her way making her believe that she is way too young for his jaded tastes.

Ten years later the two are forced to confront their feelings because Sharon's dad has bequeathed the ranch to the both of them but they must marry to inherit. They decide to go through with a marriage with plans to annul it fairly quickly but Sharon realizes her feelings for Taylor have not gone away.

This novel deals with some big issues like post traumatic stress, loneliness and fear. Taylor is very complex and he is hurting. His transformation from an angry young man to a mature businessman is believable. Sharon is not as interesting as Taylor (how could she be, she's a run-of-the-mill lawyer in Philadelphia) but she is generous and it is her giving heart that makes such a difference in Taylor's life.",0

NOAH'S COMPASS features Liam Pennywell.  In the opening pages, we learn that he has lost his job as a teacher and that he is moving from his apartment into a smaller one to economize.  We discover a few other bits and pieces as well:  he has been married twice (he is divorced from his second wife), and he has three grown daughters plus an older sister.  And then, after an exhausting day of moving and having settled gratefully into bed, Liam wakes up the next day in a hospital, with no memory of how he got there.

This is certainly an interesting premise for a novel.  Liam has not forgotten who HE is; rather, he simply has selective amnesia for the events surrounding the break-in to his home (for he is told that is what happened) and everything immediately thereafter.  Initially, he becomes obsessed with getting these memories back, which leads him on sort of a quest, bringing a new woman unexpectedly into his life, Eunice.  But from here, the book becomes much more haphazard, taking many seemingly random twists and turns--e.g., we learn more about Liam's past, there is some development in the relationship with his daughters, etc.

Ultimately, however, there seems to be no true purpose to this story.  Although I found Liam likable and was actually rooting for him, there just wasn't much to root for by the end of the novel.  So, while the reading of this book was mostly enjoyable, the lack of a satisfying conclusion was disappointing, and with that, I give it a final rating of 3 1/2 stars.",0

Books_5,2,OR,"I obtained an advance reader's copy of this book some time ago and had several false starts trying to read it.
My first attempt was on an Orlando to LAX flight - I literally had nothing else to do but open the book and read.
Somehow, I just couldn't get into it.  Some books draw you in and hold on to you even after you're finished.  This is certainly not one of those types of books.

My second attempt was in a car dealer's waiting room.  I opted to wait for my car.  Due to an unexpected delay finding a specific part, my estimates one hour wait turned into a 3 hour wait.  Again, I resumed reading this book yet couldn't manage to make myself turn the pages.  I read a couple more chapters but still couldn't muster enough interest to continue.

Then I find myself on another coast to coast flight, this time in a comfy seat up front.  Near the endpoint of the flight, my seat-neighbor asks me how the book is...I told him that I have tried to read it several times but I can't seem to garner enough interest.  I mentioned that I fell asleep twice trying to force myself to read the pages.  I also told him of my plan to review it on Amazon and that it would not be fair to review the work until I have properly read it.

All of that said, I finally did sit down and read the book.  Yes, the first third seems to plod along.  The book does pick up some, probably because I developed a form of literary Stockholm syndrome being a slave to its pages.

Overall - the novel's plot development is slow.  The characters, and there were too many of them, were not especially memorable for me.  The whole thing was predictable.  I would not recommend this book.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith is an interesting book with multiple layers that can be appreciated by readers aged 13 an up. The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.

With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door,  it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.

The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parents

I served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.

The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it.",0
Books_5,4,CG,"Other reviews have described the book as ""the best"" of its kind, and I'm not.

I had a lot of fun with this book, but I was not as enthralled as I was in the first book. There are some parts that I find amusing, but mostly it's just a quick read. I'm not sure if it's a good book or not, but I will say that it's pretty good.

The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad. They just seem to be sort of stuck in the past. It's a nice way to introduce new characters and introduce a lot of new ideas.

I think I'm going to give this book a four star, but I have to say that I didn't like the ending, and I really didn't like the way the author ended it. I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.

Books_5,4,OR,"First of all, you cannot compare ANY books to the Diana Gabaldon series. So, when reading this book, you have to treat it as if you would any other type of book. You wouldn't compare any other authors to Stephen King or Dean Koontz, so you can't compare this book to the Oulander series either.
With that said, this book tells a great story. There's time travel, war, & romance. The story doesn't elaborate on war much at all, just basically that there is one and that's about the gist of it. But the romance that builds between the charaters and the way the author describes them is awesome! I actually laughed out loud when I read parts of this book and I did get tears in my eyes during one part. (But I won't give any of it away) You will fall in love with Circenn, and the passion he has for Lisa.
The story begins when Lisa goes back in time, she meets Circenn. Her first meeting with him and he is naked. She can't believe how barbaric & sexy he is at the same time. Right from the start you have compassion for Circenn. You also get annoyed at Lisa for being the typical mouthy female. (Come on ladies, you know what I mean!) As the story goes on you warm up to Lisa. She doesn't do, try, or say anything that you wouldn't do in today's society. Which is all she knows no matter what century she is in. You begin to feel both of their pain, and both of their passions. The end of the story takes you by suprise. I was not expecting an ending like that, but it was a pleasent ending none the less.

Books_5,4,OR,"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others.",0
Books_5,5,OR,"Here's a wonderful book for any fan of Ursula Le Guin. It begins with a foreword by the author in which she outlines each of the stories, most of which take place on worlds of her well-known Ekumen, her &#147;Hainish Universe.&#148;. However alien the cultures may be, however strange their societal structures and customs, Ms. Le Guin uses each tale to underscore what truly unites us and makes us human. These stories comprise the first two-thirds of the book.
As much as I relish Le Guin&#146;s Hainish stories, it is the novelette &#147;Paradises Lost,&#148; comprising the final third of the book, that is most rewarding. It&#146;s a change of pace for the author, involving not the worlds of the Ekumen, but rather a generation spacecraft on a 201-year voyage from Earth to a &#147;New Earth&#148; orbiting some unnamed neighboring star. Most of the narrative involves characters who have lived their entire lives in this self-contained bubble of metal and air. They know nothing of Earth save what they have experienced via films and &#147;virtual reality&#148; programs. The simple concept of &#147;sky&#148; is completely unfathomable to them. They have their own rituals and customs with which they structure their lives until it becomes necessary to debark on the surface of a new world. Ultimately, for some hese colonists who have become comfortable in their self-contained universe, the notions of OUTSIDE and NEW WORLD begin to seem rather intimidating and even evil. How will they cope when the spacecraft arrives at its destination? Ms. Le Guin deftly explores this culture and its destiny, and the ending quite literally brought tears to my eyes. Throughout &#147;The Birthday of the World,&#148; we realize how much we have in common as human beings, no matter whether we are on Gethen, in a spaceship, on Earth, or anywhere in the universe, that we have our loves, our hopes, and our fears, and that EVERY DAY is the birthday of the world.",0

While she often feels uneasy at the sight of blood. Rose is determined to prove herself capable. Future will mean returning home to marry the aging bachelor her mother has chosen for her  a bloated, disgusting merchant who make Rose feel ill. When Lord Hamlin, the future duck, is injured, it is Rose who must tend to him. As she works to heal his wound, she begins to understand emotions shes never felt before and wonders if he feel the same. But falling in love is forbidden, as Lord Hamlin is betrothed to a mysterious young woman in hiding. As Roses life spins toward confusion. She must take the first steps in a journey to discover her own destiny. Although Rose is not as courage as the other books heroines, shes more a bit old fashion compare to other characters in other book(perhapsI guess only a little) Bur she has her advantages, shes kind, she try her best to help her friends, and full of responsibility. She knew she cant be with Lord Hamlin because of the betrothed, so she decided to sacrificed her own happiness rather the good of Hagenheim. Besides all of that, shes a story teller!! How interesting! So for those who concern the shallow characters, I think its better to consider this book as a beautiful fairy tale rather than a contemporary novel. (the book itself is based on the Medieval term, sojust think read the book as Romeo and Juliet, but with happy ending. )  Forget the plot about a damsel in distress, youll find yourselves enjoyed a gorgeous romance story.

Books_5,4,OR,"Even though I'm giving this four stars, part of me isn't sure I did like it very much - but that's not because Roberto Saviano's brutal and intense story wasn't interesting (via what seems a very good translation). Mostly, it's because of the nihilism of the cocaine industry, and the pointlessness of trying to do much about it. The cartels have all the power, and the money is so huge that of course they will do anything to maintain it - and frankly, banks probably depend on the cash infusions as well.

So what we're left with is a grim, brutal and horrible look at an industry that does infect our lives probably more than we like to admit. But what can we do about it? Not much. And is being educated/informed about it worth reading about it? I'm really not sure. I feel like I generally knew most of what Saviano wrote about so ably, but he certainly rubbed my nose in these gruesome stories. Is that a good thing? And why? I don't know if I have an answer for that!

I respect Saviano going all-in with this story, though, and just having this book out there is important. So even if a reader is turned off by these horrible stories, at least they have been told. So I don't need to like the story - and I think a reader should just respect the story. As long as that's accomplished, the book did its job - it shouldn't be be 'fun and glamorous' and it is not.

Readers of criminal justice will appreciate this - especially fans of true crime accounts (which I'm generally not, I have to say), so it absolutely has an audience. I'm giving it four stars with some general reservations, but with a solid appreciation for the take-no-prisoners account that Saviano has provided. He hammers the topic home, and it takes all the glamour out of the drug, that's for sure.",0

I'm not sure if I loved it, but I definitely didn't hate it. The book is indeed, as some reviewers pointed out, plot driven. The reader is constantly wondering what will happen next. Will our main character die of a fever or step on a poisonous snake?

But I disagree with some reviewers who feel the characters were not well drawn. In fact, my mom and I talked about the book and speculated about what would happen next. We are sure a sequel is possible. That tells me that we liked the characters enough to see them again.

What was so remarkable about this story was the place. Set in the heart of Brazil and then deep in the Amazon jungle, the book gives a vivid and beautifully written description of place. Readers never feel as if the author has taken us away from the perils that lie everywhere. It makes me not want to visit that part of the world!

The only reason I gave this book 4 instead of 5 stars was the inability to believe certain things. I found myself coming out of the story (not good for a reader) and thinking, ""no way!"" First of all, would a pharma company invest that much time and money on a project and get no status reports, not a one? I doubt it. Would investors in that company allow it to do so? Perhaps for a short while but not for years. Secondly, what the strange and elusive Dr. Swenson was investigating seemed way beyond my ability to suspend disbelief.

Books_5,3,OR,"I purchase this book to flesh out data regarding life in post war Europe.  Having interviewed survivors of the conflict in both eastern and western Europe I was disappointed at the lack of substance and the lack of clarity of the author.  It started with the author's allegation that there is a vast amount of information about Eastern Europe and his intention to portray a balanced look at Europe as a whole.  Surprisingly, the focus continued to be Western Europe with some information regarding Eastern Europe.  For, example is that a crucial piece of data omitted as to the penalty for harboring a Jew in occupied Europe:  Specifically, that only in Poland was a death penalty imposed.  Then, the misrepresentation of facts and eyewitness accounts to fit the author's notions.  For example, Lowe reported soviet atrocities seemingly as portrayed by Nazi propaganda (""...according to the German Captain..."") whilst minimizing Soviet eyewitnesses German atrocities (""...claimed a Read Army soldier..."").  I can go on ad infinitum but will relay an omission of fact.  Upon annexing western Poland into the Reich, the Germans proceeded to deport Polish inhabitants to the General Government area with the vacant house occupied by colonizers.  What could have been an excellent book on the subject of post war struggles to survive turned out to be a book with slanted conclusions as well as selective presentation of facts.

One thing that the author did capture correctly albeit again slanted was the actions of the western soldiers.  We hear of the raping of French colonial troops.  We hear how the Americans paid desperate women for sex (which is a form of rape).  However, we hear that the British soldier were disgusted.  Can it be that Lowe is a British author?  A vast majority of soldiers behave badly in war.  The rarity is the noble soldier who does nothing bad or evil.",0

Books_5,5,OR,"As a lifelong Lakers fan and the absolute biggest Boston Celtics hater you will ever find, I was somewhat doubtful whether I should buy this book. I was well aware of the sports guys almost pathological hatred of great Lakers such as Kareem and Kobe and I did not think he could do a book and be fair in his pyramid ratings of them, nor anyone who didn`t play for the Celtics. I finally got the book and am glad I did. Simmons took plenty of shots at Kareem, but, ultimately gave him a 3rd best player ever rating. At the beginning of the book, Simmons went into great detail as to why he says Bill Russell was a greater player than Wilt, and his arguments and historical proof of his opinion was so accurate that I have to change my own opinion ad go over to the Sports Guys side-Russ was better than Wilt. His rating of Kobe at only the 15th best player ever was ridiculous. With Kobe`s 4th ring won in 2009 (without Shaq to you Kobe haters) was the final hurdle he had to get over to be rated as one of the top 7 or 8 players ever. West and Oscar won one championship each, Wilt and Kareem were the MVP`s on the teams that they did win their one ring on, and Kobe has won 4 and, yet, Simmons rates him behind both of them? Laughable. No sport places a higher premium on the all time status of players being based on championships won than pro basketball. With that truth, Bird with 3 rings, rated way higher than Kobe with his 4. Well, thats just the Celtic bias coming through since Simmons makes quite clear he thinks the sun sets on Bird`s rear end. Oh well, basically the book was fair, it was funny , it was worth 700 pages and would be a nice addition to any basketball fans library.",0

You have to love a book that leaves you smiling as you read the last lines of the book and then sends you to the internet immediately to buy book 2. Charley Davidson is a ""grim reaper"", but not in the traditional sense that we all know. She is a portal through which those who didn't immediately cross over can use to get where they're supposed to go - presumably Heaven. The dead see her as this bright light, which they are usually drawn to, and she sometimes has to help them with their unfinished business before they are ready to cross over. She is also a very witty, sarcastic Private Investigator, and she's very good at it, with the help that she receives from some of the dearly departed. Oh, and there's this supernatural being that comes to her in the night in her dreams and has his way with her, and she's pretty happy about it. While I'm not one who is drawn to those lusty, cliche romance novels, I do love paranormal fiction and suspense, so this book fit the bill. Add to that, Charley's sarcastic sense of humor, which I am all over, and this made for a very quick, enjoyable read. The book is peppered throughout with little sarcastic one-liners, some of which had me laughing out loud and feeling silly, since my family had no idea what was so funny. Some reviewers commented that they were excessive, and maybe so, but not to the point where it might have taken away from my enjoyment of the book.

Books_5,4,OR,"These sorts novels rest a lot on believable characters. The problem with Florida novels is that real living characters in Florida often eclipse any fictional characters for stupidity, corruption and evil intent. This is the state that attracts serial killers, Koran burning ministers, scammers and con artists, and whose main reputation in other states for monumental zaniness. Here Randy Wayne White has created a sane grounded, and admirable character. Most importantly he doesn't make her a superwomen, kung fu warrior. She's brave and tough and smart, but she makes mistakes in a dangerous situation that are both human and suspenseful. The sort that anyone placed in a highly stressful situation would make. My complaint about a lot of writers in this genre is their characters are too masterful and unbelievable and you can lose interest in them easily. The second part that I liked about this is its a tightly plotted ""little"" story that deals with evil and takes us on a little journey through west florida and the thousand islands. And that too makes it very readable. The challenge for Randy White is that of a male trying to write in the first person about a female. I think it's extremely difficult to do. And I think the author does a good job of this. But not quite. Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It could be that as a fan I could not forget the male Doc of his other novels, and I had the odd sensation of the marine biologist sort of springing out in drag sometimes. I'm pretty much convinced though that this is more my fault than the authors. If you are a fan read this one. It's even better if you are new to his fiction. It's great, and a new start, for White.

Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and  read Kant at night.  i find it nearly impossible to believe.  Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time.  She has powerful friends.  In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.

If he is so inclined, it would be to give readers the opportunity to experience a deeper understanding of the family and its influence in the life of the characters. This is a wonderful book for young people to read as they grow up and develop their own lives and interests. It also provides a good book for adults to read to their children and their families. I loved this book. It was written in a very easy to understand style, and I'm not sure why I was so excited to read it. I like that the story is not over at the end, but the book is written as if it was, and I hope there is a sequel. I also like that it was written in a little more style, as the characters seem more real. I liked how the author used the example of a priest who had a kid with his own problems. I also liked how the author used the word ""con"" to describe the kids. The book was written in a very easy to understand style, and I was excited to read it. I have never read a book that was written in such a simple style, and this book is perfect for that. I will say, I was very impressed with this book. It was very descriptive and well written.

Books_5,4,OR,"First, the outstanding quality of Joanne Harris' writing is her use of mouth-watering culinary descriptions.
Her plot here is much more involved than in Blackberry Wine, and much darker.  I happen to like the darker in terms of reading (my favorite is C.J. Cherryh's Cyteen; check THAT out), but I do have to say the narrator was hard to sit next to for the length of the book.  Witty and earnest and devious as a child; witty and earnest as a sixty-year-old, but much crankier, and though she retains her spirit, she has lost the deviousness which made her younger self a delight.  Case in point:  When a loud neighbor and competitor moves in, her strategies to combat him are downright ordinary, exactly what youth would expect of the rigid elderly.  Her triumph is the sort of thing I can see my grandmother sitting in her living room telling to her elderly friends, while they nod in agreement.  ""And >I< told HIM...""
Some of the reviews seem appalled that the younger Framboise went to such measures to torment her ""poor"" mother.  Poor nothing!  Framboise fought back in what was an intolerable environment.  By the end of the novel one can see her mother does care about her children (though unable to show it) and has her own problems, but one is still hard-pressed not to root for Framboise and her siblings in the situation.
I do have to agree with one reviewer and say kudos to Paul for sticking around the whole time, though I can't see why he does.  Framboise is fortunate he does.
All in all, a great character sketch of the lesser parts of being human.  And the ending made me want to put down the book and go on in denial, making up my own ending and pretending it was the real one -- but that's good, it means it's powerful.  Sad is more powerful than happy.",0

Hit and Run was first published in 1989, so our heroine, Delilah, has to work this case the old fashioned waywithout the internet or even a cell phone. She doesnt actually witness the Trans Am mowing down the elderly man; she hears tires squealing and a thud while pulling herself up from where she landed when the car climbed the curb and she dove for safety. Then, she found the body of Joseph Collins in the street while limping to a telephone booth trying to figure out who to call for a ride. So when the teenage driver, Michael Moraless mother swears the old man was already lying dead in the street, and Mike did not realize hed even hit a human being, Delilah agrees to think about taking the case. And thats when things start to get really weird.

The janitor in Delilahs office building (where shes living, hoping business will pick up) is a would-be sleuth named Harry Polk who is thrilled to have a real PI in the place. Her self-appointed assistant, he gets beaten up by someone who doesnt want her to pursue her investigation. Charlie Colfax, a friend of her late husband, shows up frequently, offering her various jobs, trying to get her to close her office and work for him.

Hit and Run sucked me in on the first page and didn't spit me out until the end. I liked Delilah and the people around her. The only glitch I found was a tendency to use adjectives when Ms. OCallaghan should have used adverbs, a trend I see about as often as comma splices which were blessedly missing from this book. The characters were well drawn, and the dialogue was natural. Delilah West is the forerunner and role model for such female sleuths as V.I. Warshawski and Stephanie Plum, and she sets the bar pretty high. Grab Hit and Run while you can, and see how it all started.",0

Ms. Moning has a great passion for storytelling. More than once I was tempted to highlight sentences or passages because they were phrased so well. Of course, I was so engrossed in the book that I could not be bothered to put the book down long enough to get a highlighter.

This story is fun to read and is based on supernatural beings called Berserkers which were supposed to have existed in Scotland many years ago. We watch the character of Grimm go through a transformation as he attempts to hide his true nature from the world and then, through circumstance, reveal himself to close friends and to the woman that he loves.

One of the things that I love about Ms. Moning's books is they all have this element of fearing to reveal our true self to the person we love the most, even when that person is the person who understands us best of all. When the moment finally comes to share ourselves, we find that the other person knew the truth and accepted us all along.

I love the scene in the church when Jillian's father says that love involves having passion, so much passion that you'd be willing to kidnap your beloved before she turned to someone else. You really get the sense of divine intervention in this book. This man and this woman are made for one another and no matter what they do to deny it, fate always steps in and thrusts them together until they are ready to accept it.

Books_5,4,OR,"At its best, this book is an amusing memoir about working as a presidential speechwriter, and a patriotic assessment of what government can do to help people. It doesn't always maintain that level though. List tells his story in roughly chronological order, but there isn't anything like a traditional dramatic arc here -- we get discussion of a good political thing, then a speech about infrastructure, a speech about correctional policy, the White House Correspondents' Dinner, a bad political thing, a speech about health care, another White House Correspondents' Dinner, etc. Books by political insiders can be fascinating but Litt was not really an insider. Stories are fueled by proximity to power and to important decisions, but Litt never really got that. He shares with us some funny jokes, and these are the best part of the book. A collection of his favorite Obama humor might have worked better than the book we actually got.

Yes, we get the story of how Litt got his job in the White House, buffered by his assurance to the reader that he didn't really deserve the job and repeated apologies for being white (starting on page 40 when he gets an internship with West Wing Writers). Litt does have some nice turns of phrase in the book; I particularly liked his judgment that the president doesn't play chess, he plays whack-a-mole. Many famous people appear in cameos, including an unpleasant run-in with Harvey Weinstein that's a lot more interesting to read now than it would have been a month ago. The Republican party's weird love affair with Vladimir Putin starting in 2014 gets called out as well; I suspect we'll hear more about that over time.

I had started to think that this series was in danger of going stale. The prose is adequate and easy to read, but hardly full of spirit and at times seems a little perfunctory, and Alex Delaware has also remained a rather static - if very likeable - character.

This may be his lone of his longest Delaware books to date, but every word is fascinating, and there seems to me to be fresh fire in the writing. The characters are all very well developed, and although Kellerman never really takes any risks with his well-structured plot, it's a complex and clever book that really kicks the brain into gear, and presents one or two nice surprises along the way.

Books_5,4,OR,"The mystery in this book was as decent and solid as any in the series, but I found it overshadowed by Hamish's bizarre decisions when it came to women.  Granted, he's never been particularly successful, but at this point it's been drawn out so far it's becoming painful.  In this case a part of it was necessary to the plot, but it still had me cringing to read it.

I think this is the part of Hamish's personality that I have difficulty pinning down, despite having read most of the books in the series.  Perhaps watching the BBC television series further muddled the waters, because the character there was slightly different than the man I envisioned through reading the books.  His attitude towards women and relationships seems slightly off (not in any bad way, but in a 'sometimes old fashioned' and 'sometimes suddenly very modern' way) and it throws the character out of balance.  In truth, I'd prefer the series much more if the love life aspect was dropped more by the wayside.  There have been some books where it was merely an aside mentioned, and I wish more were that way.  Because the series has gone on for so long, and we've gotten to know some of the characters so well, it's in danger of slipping more into a soap opera than a set of neat, tidy little mysteries.

Compared to some of the other books in the series, this one was a little lacking.  However, compared to a lot of other mystery series, it was still fairly decent.  I'd say dedicated fans of the series should definitely read it, but newcomers really should start at the beginning to really understand the dynamics of the relationships.

Im a powerful land baron with an eye patch. Nay, a feudal samurai lord. No, Im an oil tycoon. Fabulously rich, silver-haired, steely-eyed and whats this? Im in turbulent fight with my lover, no my sister, no my lover and her vengeful son. He has gun. So do I! This tension is terrifying. Daydream continued in the next paragraph.

I am more lost in this daydream than any I have ever had. Its spellbinding. Its tear-jerking. Spine-tingling. There are plots upon plots upon plots. It twists, it turns. Its a veritable roller coaster ride of goddamn emotion. This is by far the most powerful daydream Ive ever experienced. It feels like an eternity, yet no time has passed. I am exhausted.

Charmaine does work a few hours in a dive bar; her best friends now are prostitutes who service their customers in the back room. So when Charmaine sees an ad on TV for the Positron Project in the town of Consilience the couples decides they have nothing to lose. They board a bus for the complimentary trip, they're wined and dined and put up in a nice hotelhot showers! fresh bedsheets! wine with dinner! Not everyone gets in, mind you, and Stan and Charmaine go through a series of workshops meant to weed out the undesirables. If they make it, a house in the cute little 50s-era town of Consilience is theirs. The catch? They spend 30 days in the Positron Prison and 30 days as townspeople for the rest of their lives. Because theres no leaving the Project once you sign on the dotted line. The towns motto? Do time now, buy time for our future. Cons + Resilience = Consilience. Yikes. The rest of the novel is a whirl of selective euthanasia and sex robots and Elvis impersonators and an attempted escape to Las Vegas, of all places!

He knows what he wants from life and how he is going to get it.  The only thing that throws him off is how much he wants his best friend Zoe McCleary.  Jericho biggest issue with Zoe is she does not commit to anything.

Zoe McCleary says and does whatever pops into her head.  She is still in school because she has changed her major multiple time.  She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.

The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.

I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.

Books_5,5,OR,"I bought the Inferno somewhat reluctantly because of all the negative reviews.  But since I have loved all of Brown's previous books, it seemed worth a chance. I am an avid reader of nonfiction - have a library of thousands - and occasionally read fiction recreationally. Brown is one of the few fiction writers that I enjoy, because he so elequently sets the scene of his stories, and describes the locations in great depth. These are usually places that I will never see, but definitely would have, if the circumstances of my life had been different. It seems that this has been a problem for many reviewers, but for me, it is one of the many reasons that Brown's books never fail to enchant me.

The next issue that appears to have bothered some reviewers was the topic of overpopulation.  This has been addressed often by scientists, anthropologists, and sociologists, among others, and yet I don't hear it discussed among the general population as more than a passing topic. It is as though the subject is of no concern to most people. But to make it the subject of a novel, by such a renowned writer, people will become more aware, and perhaps even research the issue... and who knows...  even do something about it.

That was what I experienced when The DaVinci Code was on the best seller lists. Everywhere I went people were talking about it. Some were appalled by the ideas Brown put forth, but many were fascinated by the ideas and were researching the early Christian era to find out more about it.

I have always had an interest in the Divine Comedy, and so, really appreciated reading a novel that featured it so highly. Also, Brown certainly had me on the edge of my seat with all the dramatic chase scenes and all the unknowns such as his amnesia.

Books_5,3,OR,Kate and her daughter live in a house that is falling apart around them. She was married for five years to an abusive husband. There is a mystery surrounding Joseph's death and his brother Ryan is holding it over her head. I sympathize with the h's that Anderson creates. Her h usually tend to have a handicap or dark past of some kind. The H is usually strong and protective and neither are disloyal or unfaithful to one another. Miranda is an adorable four year old but I have to say Chloe from Silver Thaw has been my favorite up to tis point. Zach McGovern is Katie's neighbor and as hard as Kate tries to keep him away from her and Miranda she finds herself caring for him right under her roof. The relationship between the two is slow at first but when you learn of Kate's first marriage it makes sense. What a nightmare she went through and with Ryan still threatening not just her but violence to her little girl she leans on Zach for protection. That is always my favorite part when the h finally puts her trust in the H. He does not disappoint either. The trouble I had with the book was it's similarities to Silver Thaw. The h in ST was nicknamed Mandy just as the little girl in this read. Chloe refers to the H as Mr. Jeb and Daddy Jeb. Miranda calls the H Mr. Zach and papa Zach. There are legalities to be dealt with in both as well. It is still a good read and the author takes her characters on their journey nice and slow so you really feel the bond between them. The love scenes take a back seat but you will still find it within. The healing and building of trust is the main point that the author drives home topped off with love. If you're looking for a steamy book this book will not fill your need as it shows the softer side of love.,0
Books_5,5,OR,"I was cleaning out some boxes of children's books, keeping what I consider classic while giving the rest to my grandchildren or to the libraries. I doubled-back between this current edition and the previous editions to make sure this was the same one...it is, and I highly recommend this. I took a class in children's literature back in the 70's and I fondly remember it as being one of the most enjoyable classes I had in college the first time around. This book lasted through my children's growing up and is now going through new useage with my grandchildren. I love the way this book is organized. If you have a child with specific interests such as limericks (and I know few children who don't get a kick out of limericks) you can go to that section without delay.
I grew up with Joan Walsh Anglund poignant drawings. They are not particularly 'great' art, but for children and in this book, they are vastly more suitable than the poorly drawn and maddening stuff put out in cartoons (especially of the Pokemon variety which will set off seizures in children). They say the age of this book is for four years to eight year olds. That isn't true. Every parent should try to take the time to read to all children in whatever form necessary...and it should start at age one. Reading aloud (or signing books) to your children not only makes essential bonds, but it also teaches children what you think is important, and also teaches them how to stop and pay attention. The massive complaints about restless children and the abuse of labeling (ADD/ADHD) has its beginnings in simple things such as turning the television/computers off and reading to your children.
... should be showing the pictures and pages of this book in a sampling, so that parents can make informed decisions about children's books. If you only get one child's book this year, get this one and sit down with your children and read.

Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.

Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands  love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.

Smillas  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.

Books_5,5,OR,"I've had the chance to read quite a few books that provide guidance and examples of how to become a better professional designer. After reading David Berman's most book Do Good Design, I find myself to be enlightened and newly aware of the social influence and ethical accountability of visual design.

David states that technology has turned the world into designers via personalized interfaces, computers, and cell phones which segues into the his core thoughts:

- Designers have more power than they realize
- The largest threat to humanity's future just may be the consumption of more than necessary
- Human civilization...can not afford one more major global goof
- The same design that fuels mass overconsumption also holds the power to repair the world
- We live in an unprecedented technological age where we can each reach a larger legacy by propagating our best ideas than by propagating our chromosomes
- Designers can be a model for other professions for identifying ones' sphere of influence, and then embrace the responsibility that accompanies the power to help repair the world
- Don't just do good design, do good

While I won't list all of the book's chapters (Amazon already has a TOC link), I'll highlight a memorable quote from each major section:

- The Creative Brief: Disarming Weapons of Mass Deception
""Designers can use their professional power, persuasive skills, and wisdom to help distribute ideas the world really needs""

- The Design Solution: Convenient Truths
""Imagine again a society's potential where the largest signs, the cleverest ads, the most prominent messages promote healthy behaviors....We can choose it now.""

- The Do Good Pledge
Immediacy - The time to commit is now
Ethics - I will be true to my profession
Principles - I will be true to myself
Effort - I will spend at least 10 percent of my professional time helping repair the world

I don't think I ever took notice of the magnitude of ads / visual lies that were around me before I read David's book. I HIGHLY recommend this book and I hope that once people read it, we can start showing the truth altogether.",0

Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book. Compared to the other Dessen books Ive read, this one isn't as good, but I still found myself entertained while reading it. More book reviews at Stealingpages.",0
Books_5,3,OR,"The story: Betrayed by her new husband, lovely Scottish bride Iolanthe MacLeod dies by the sword in the fall of 1382 in a landlocked keep on the English moors, far from the sea she loves. She gives up on her dreams of a man coming to rescue her and spends the next 600 years haunting the castle were she was killed. However, when Thomas McKinnon arrives to see the castle he purchased in 2001, she  recognizes him as the man from her dreams. At first all Thomas wants to do is restore his crumbling old castle, but he finds himself falling in love with a ghost. Now all he has to do is find a way for Iolanthe to become a permanent part of his world.
  This is my first book to read by Lynn Kurland, and to be fair, it would have been better if I had read her other books first. She has a whole series on the MacLeods/MacKinnons/De Piagets. However, I do think that books in a series should be able to stand on their own and this falls a little short. There are too many back stories that need to be explained, and a lot of loose ends that are not tied (presumably these will be explained in later books).
  This story does invovle time travel, and ghosts, so it requires a lot of imagination on the reader's part. The relationship between Thomas and the ghost inhabitants of the castle is quite funny and some of the supporting characters are quite likable. I loved the part where Iolanthe uses Thomas's computer to teach the garrison how to read. The part of the story where Thomas rescue's Iolanthe is also quite exciting and romantic. There are no love scenes in this book, only a few kisses and embraces. There is some violence and descritpions of battle scenes. If you like books in a series, I would recommend this book, but if not, then you may want to skip this one.

Books_5,5,OR,"To everyone who surrounds Margo Roth Spiegelman, she is an adventurous, unconventional, and intelligent person and a highly admired someone that everyone puts on a pedestal. So when Margo sneaks into Quentin Jacobsen's room one glorious night and involves him in her crazy exploits, he can't help but feel as if a new page has been turned, and just maybe he can be a part of the marvelous Margo's life.

But the next morning all of Quentin's hopes are dashed with Margo's disappearance. Her parents and the police think this is just another one of her stunts, but Q's not so sure. Because Margo has left him a string of clues, one right after another, which just might lead him to her. But the thing is, he's not sure what he'll find.

John Green brings readers another surprising, witty, and fully honest book in Paper Towns. His writing is captivating from the very beginning as multitudes of details, no mater how large of small, flow seamlessly together. Green has a knack for highlighting the little distinguishing factors that make us human, making for more believable characters and completely enthralling book.

The mystery in Paper Towns is clever, and will leave readers scratching their heads as Q and his friends struggle to piece together the clues with some frustration and tons of humor. But the teens are just as quick to get serious as they contemplate what has actually happened to Margo and as Quentin especially comes to see her in a completely different light with a little help from the poetry of Walt Whitman.

Though Paper Towns did slow down a little bit in the middle of the book as Quentin hits a brick wall in his search, this novel is suspenseful, hilarious, and quirky, and especially appealing to the well read teen. The characters are as real as your own friends, and teens can't help but see pieces of their own lives in this amazingly candid book. Read at your own risk though--Green's works are completely addictive, and once you start, it's impossible to stop.",0

Books_5,5,OR,"I kept feeling like this man must have been to these places where warlords rule. The warlords, the economy, child soldiers all of it was brought to life, but in the context of upper-class America. The book is dark, but it's not actually dark enough to fully bring it to life. However, I think that's a good thing, because the reality is so horrific that it would damage his relationship to his readers. It's enough. I say this as someone who has published for West Point on the subject of warlords. Paolo has the dynamics of the soldier boys down. I kept wondering, ""Did this guy live it?"" which is about as good a compliment as one can give an author.

His creatures are very good. There are coywolves, also called red wolves. That bounced me out of the story a bit, but then I realized that he connected me into the world that way. The genetically engineered creature named Tool was interesting. I found myself wondering how to make him, and realizing that he could be made, one at a time as a chimera, through surgery in utero. Which was a bit of a brrr, moment. The conditioning though, that would be harder.

It's good sci-fi, but it's more than just a story. It gives an opportunity for Americans to feel what it's like to be caught up in such madness. The madness exists today - even now.

The one thing I would have liked though, is for the Drowned Cities to run piracy operations like is done off the coast of Somalia. (It won't surprise me if Libya starts doing it too, but inside the Mediterranean it can't be ignored as much as Somali.) That's a tiny miss to his economy of the cities.

By the way, the Zulus - on theory about this tribe is that they descended from a lost Roman garrison on the southern end of the empire after Rome disintegrated. The garrison became a tribe with roots in military traditions, much like the depiction of the warlord armies of the Drowned Cities.",0

Books_5,3,OR,"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that was Allegiant, which was in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book was available for free at my library and the other books I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short stories is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the stories themselves, knowing the truth behind everything as revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I was forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these stories for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the stories were just okay. While we do learn some new details about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which covers a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it was just. okay. Altogether the collection was a three-star read. There was nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. It's really not worth taking up permanent residence on your bookshelf or Kindle library.

Books_5,4,OR,"INVENTING GEORGE WASHINGTON:  AMERICA'S FOUNDER IN MYTH AND MEMORY is an interesting look into some of the many stories we've all heard about George Washington.  Edward Lengel's primary focus in this book isn't so much the myths themselves, but their place in American lore and, more importantly, the reasons behind their origination.  While we all know the ""chopping down the cherry tree"" story is whole-cloth fiction, you'd be surprised at some of the real sources of George Washington quotes and lore that Lengel exposes.

While some were innocent enough embellishments upon actual events or wholly made-up fiction, the reasons behind others are far from innocent.  Whether used for the villification of Washington and the American Experiment OR to further the ends of the idea that America is a ""just cause,"" Lengel delves into the prevelance of the mythology in todays world.

Even after exhaustive publication of authenticated writings directly from the hand of George Washington, many of the myths retain their seeming veracity.  Whether taken from forged writings of George Washington or from the imagination of biographers, admirers or detractors, you'd be surprised by the quoatation of these stories in todays modern era--usually to serve modern political ends.

While Lengel seemed to make no conclusion as to what to do about this problem, it left this reader with one thought in mind:  Before you tell any story--good or bad--or attribute any quotation to George Washington, make sure YOU do your own research and verify its sourcing.  As to the legends?  Maybe they DO serve a purpose and DO have a place in American society. If not for some of them, it might be kind of hard to inspire the American people and keep ol' G.W. ""..first in the hearts of his countrymen.""

I give this book FOUR STARS.  Well worth the read if you have even a passing interest in discovering the REAL George Washington.  Although, that will require additional careful research on your part, you'll at least have a new found suspicion for stories and qoutes being bandied about today!",0

I started as many readers with the more modern day stories and then I went back and read the famous, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  Comparing the earlier Le Carre to the later day author is night and day.  So I decided to start at the beginning - Call for the Dead.

George Smiley is introduced to us in this book.  He is not the supreme spymaster at this point that he becomes later.  Some may argue this point, as his storied heroics from WWII are on display.  But he is not so confident of his skills or his governmental position.  His personal strife with the divorce of his wife Ann is described and this adds to his personality.  Smiley is not the king of the Secret World at this point and his inexperience is fun to see.

The story is very short on pages, but not on important developments.  At this stage of Le Carre's career, he could say much with few words.  The characters are surprisingly well developed in 128 pages.  The intricacies of the storyline are well thought out and the ending, if not totally surprising, is explained in detail - something that doesn't happen so often in Le Carre's later writings.

I found myself wired in to this story for no other reason that I felt I was watching the manifestations of some of the most famous spy characters in history - Mundt and Smiley.  I can't say that the story is so twisted that the reader can't figure it out, but I will say that the writing is so well done, that you can't help but read every word.  The reader can begin to see the mind of Le Carre as he takes a simple plotline and attempts to weave it a myriad of ways.

Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.

The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind.",0
